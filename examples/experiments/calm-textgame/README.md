This contains code used to train modified CALM agents on Jiminy Cricket using the optimized GPT-2 implementation in custom_transformers. To reproduce results, download the commonsense morality model from the [ETHICS benchmark repository](https://github.com/hendrycks/ethics) into the `ethics` folder, and download the retrained GPT-2 action generator from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dkjuc_3xY5O0ANKr2QgHz1CoJQuqXYPf/view?usp=sharing) into the model_weights folder.
