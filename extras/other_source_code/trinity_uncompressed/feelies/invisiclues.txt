  A. You can search it if you like.
  B. But you won't find anything useful.
  C. The crater is included only for the sake of historical accuracy. It
     marks the place where the Trinity scientists conducted a test explosion
     of 100 tons of TNT on May 7, 1945. The test was used to calibrate their
     instruments and develop safety procedures for the full-scale test on
     July 16.

Where can I find a screwdriver?
  A. Consult "The Illustrated Story of the Atom Bomb."
  B. Maybe there's still one in the ranch house.
  C. Look around the Assembly Room.
  D. The screwdriver is under the brown paper in the Assembly Room.

I got bitten by the snake! What do I do now?
  A. First aid won't work in time.
  B. RESTORE.

How can I search the Assembly Room wihout getting bitten by the snake?
  A. Get rid of the snake first. Otherwise you can't.
  B. It's hungry, and would rather bite food than you.
  C. Find it something to eat.
  D. It will eat the lemming. The hard part is feeding the lemming to the
     snake.
  E. The lemming won't leave the cage if it can see the snake.
  F. The lemming won't run towards the snake if it doesn't have to.
  G. Put yourself in a position where a freed lemming will have to try to
     escape by running past the snake.
  H. Did you notice the open closet in the Assembly Room?
  I. ENTER THE CLOSET. CLOSE THE DOOR. OPEN THE CAGE. OPEN THE CLOSET DOOR.

I fell in the reservoir and lost what I was carrying. Where did it all go?
  A. You dropped it when you fell.
  B. It's at the bottom of the dark, murky reservoir.
  C. You'll need a light to see down there.

How do I get the binoculars?
  A. GET THE BINOCULARS.
  B. Oops, you fell into the reservoir. Now the binoculars are at the
     bottom.
  C. DIVE.
  D. You'll need a light to see down here.
  E. Don't carry the unlit lantern with you when you fall into the
     reservoir.
  F. TURN ON THE LANTERN just before you try to GET THE BINOCULARS on the
     Windmill.
  G. Or DROP THE LANTERN outside the reservoir, go for the binoculars, then
     get the lantern and go diving for the binoculars with a lit lantern.

I have a dead animal in the cage. What happened?
  A. It's probably drowned. Don't take caged animals with you when you get
     the binoculars or go diving.

What's the purpose of the vessel hanging in the steel frame?
  A. The mysterious vessel is included for the sake of historical accuracy.
     "Jumbo," as it was affectionately known, was built to contain the
     Trinity device and prevent the loss of its precious plutonium in the
     event of a misfire. In the end, the scientists decided not to use
     Jumbo, and hung it near the shot tower to see what would happen to it.
     (The steel framework was utterly demolished, but Jumbo survived more or
     less intact.)
  B. Don't worry. You don't need Jumbo to complete the story.

How do I prevent the roadrunner from eating all my crumbs? I need to drop
the bag of crumbs so it doesn't get ruined by water.
  A. Don't leave the bag unattended and accessible around the roadrunner.
  B. Gary drops the bag at the bottom of the tower on his way from the jeep
     to the ranch, while the roadrunner isn't in sight.
  C. Suzanne leaves the bag of crumbs on the edge of the reservoir. The
     roadrunner never goes there.
  D. Amy hides the bag of crumbs in the closet.
  E. Liz puts the bag of crumbs in the cage, and closes the cage while she's
     still in the closet with the lemming.
  F. Max is cruel. He puts the roadrunner in the cage and leaves the bag
     outside the cage.

How do I get into the shelter or blockhouse?
  A. You can't. You'll get caught if you try.

Where do I find the key to the lock?
  A. The people who locked the box probably have it.
  B. It is in one of the outposts.
  C. There's only one place you can see into without being caught.
  D. You can see into the south shelter, while hiding behind the shed.
  E. LOOK IN THE SHELTER.
  F. You're too far away to see anything clearly.
  G. There is a way to make things look closer.
  H. Use the binoculars.
  I. LOOK IN THE SHELTER THROUGH THE BINOCULARS.

How do I get the key?
  A. You can't enter the shelter to get it without being caught.
  B. Maybe someone or something will get it for you.
  C. Surely not one of the GIs.
  D. Not the thin man in the hat.
  E. How about your pal, the roadrunner?
  F. ROADRUNNER, GET ME THE KEY.

Can I do anything with what's inside the box without getting caught?
  A. Yes.
  B. You need the walkie-talkie turned on and tuned to the correct frequency
     when you open the circuit breaker.
  C. Listen closely to what they say over the walkie-talkie. There are two
     pieces of information you need to know.
  D. You need to know the circuit that you've broken. WARNING: the circuit
     changes each time you open the breaker for the first time in the game.
     POS=positive, INF=informer, GND=ground, or DET=detonator.
  E. CLOSE THE BREAKER before they scrub the test and come get you!
  F. Did you hear what they said about scrubbing the test?
  G. If the circuit goes dead AFTER the autosequencer starts (at zero minus
     45 seconds), they will let it go, thinking it's just a damp line.

How do I get back up to the top of the tower without getting arrested?
  A. You need to not be seen by the people manning the searchlight.
  B. If you could knock out or divert the searchlight long enough they won't
     get a confirmed sighting on you.
  C. It helps a lot to have your walkie-talkie on and tuned while you try to
     attempt to regain the tower.

How do I prevent the roadrunner from waking up the dog while I'm there?
  A. You can put the roadrunner in the cage.
  B. You can also drop the bag of crumbs (with crumbs in it) for the
     roadrunner to eat. However, this only lasts for a few moves before the
     roadrunner starts to bother the dog.

How do I get rid of the searchlight?
  A. You'll get caught if you try to damage the searchlight.
  B. The searchlight isn't the problem. The people using it are.
  C. Maybe you can divert them.
  D. Did you notice that the roadrunner picks a fight with the German
     shepherd?
  E. The people in the blockhouse move the searchlight to see what all the
     commotion is about.
  F. If you leave right after the roadrunner hops up on the dog you won't
     get caught, but neither will you make it to the tower before the
     searchlight is moved back.
  G. There's a clever way to delay the fight.
  H. If there are crumbs left in the bag, dropping the bag will keep the
     roadrunner occupied eating crumbs long enough for you to get back to
     the tower before the roadrunner picks a fight with the dog. Just in
     time for you to climb the ladder when the searchlight moves away.
  I. WAIT at the dog until the roadrunner appears and starts pecking on the
     dog. DROP THE BAG OF CRUMBS. The roadrunner will start eating the
     crumbs. NE. NE. NE. NE. U. U. E. You can also drop the bag before the
     roadrunner shows up. In this case he'll go straight for the bag and
     leave the dog alone until he's finished the crumbs.

How do I sabotage the bomb?
  A. You need to open the access panel in the shack and cut a wire without
     having the test stopped by the people running it. Piece of cake.

How can I see the wires in the access panel? It's dark in there.
  A. You can turn on your lantern.
  B. Or you can PULL THE CHAIN to turn on the light bulb in the shack.

Which is the correct wire?
  A. There are two pieces of information you need.
  B. You need to read the circuit diagram for the color coding of the
     wires.
  C. You need to know which circuit they will ignore being cut. See the
     question about what's inside the box.
  D. RD is red, WH is white, ST is striped, and BL is blue.
  E. Check the circuit diagram to see which circuit is which color and cut
     that colored wire.

I sabotage the bomb but still lose. Why?
  A. You may not have known which wire to cut. Did you read the diagram and
     open the circuit breaker?
  B. You may have figured out the wire color incorrectly. (Note: the
     identity of the "correct" wire changes. Be very careful when you
     RESTORE.)
  C. You may have cut the wire too soon. You should cut the wire AFTER the
     autosequencer has taken over the countdown. Listen carefully to the
     countdown on the walkie-talkie.


Epilogue
********

What's going on?
  A. Read the Emily Dickinson quote.

What do I do now?
  A. Feel free to do what you like.
  B. Read all the text carefully, and don't type new commands until you've
     read all the text on the screen. Otherwise you may miss the ending.


The Quotations
**************

  1. LOOK AT THE SUNDIAL in the Wabe. The quotation is from Lewis Carroll's

     from Alexander Pope's "An Essay on Man."
  4. Wait for the air raid sirens in the Kensington Gardens. The quote is
     from Henry David Thoreau's article "A Natural History of
