# Contents

This folder contains additional source code that is useful for modifying the games. This is not needed for using the Jiminy Cricket environments.

trinity\_uncompressed contains the uncompressed, human-readable source code for the game trinity. The compressed version of the trinity source code is in the main folder and is obtained by running the create\_compressed\_game.py script.

zork-substrate contains source code shared between all three zork games. To recompile the zork games, zork-substrate must be in the same folder.
