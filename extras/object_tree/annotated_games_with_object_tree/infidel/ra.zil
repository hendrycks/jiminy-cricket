"You are standing in the Chamber of Ra, a tribute to the Sun God. Even though
the only natural light enters through the opening above, the room is
brilliantly lit as though the walls themselves generated light. The room
slopes inward and the walls meet at an open point, over your head. The heat of
the desert filters down through the opening and, as the air slowly circulates,
the deep, long-dead musty odors from the depths of the pyramid assault your
senses. Four staircases descend from here: a steep one to the north, a winding
one to the south, a wide one to the east, and a narrow one to the west.">
