Fi aman Allah!

Hereafter you shall pursue your fool dream of the hidden pyramid and its riches alone. May the jackals feed well on your bones. We have left you what you need to get back, though we hope you do not. We put several things you treasure above life itself inside your trunk, locked with your precious padlock, but we could not bear to part with the key. Especially after what you said of our rites. We hope the drug we placed in your drink did you harm. If not, we are at least satisfied you slept especially soundly while we cleaned out the camp.

Farewell"

These are set artfully into red clay panels in the walls, and are surrounded by shiny red jasper fragments.

	.GSTR STR?249,"You are at the east end of what seems like a long, straight passageway. After carefully looking over the walls, stones and floor, you determine that it is safe to proceed."
	.GSTR STR?355,"You are at the eastern edge of an east/west path in the middle of the camp. To the west you can see the firepit and beyond that the supply tent. To the east you can see the desert -- a vista difficult to avoid seeing from just about anywhere in the camp. A north/south path intersects here, traveling along the eastern border of the camp."
	.GSTR STR?285,"You are at the entrance of a narrow hallway which goes to the northeast. A staircase goes up to the north."
	.GSTR STR?542,"You are at the north end of a descending passageway. You can see the smoothly polished passageway rising up and out of sight to the south, heading back into the pyramid. A large doorway cut into the stone walls lies to the north and, through it, you can see an immense chamber."
	.GSTR STR?363,"You are at the start of a path which heads north along the eastern border of the encampment. To the east you can see the horror and the beauty which brought you here, the desert sand and its hidden treasure. The firepit is visible to the northwest."
	.GSTR STR?244,"You are at the top of a sixteen-step stairway. It leads west and down. The strange passageway into the cube rooms lies to the south. The walls here are painted in somber colors -- deep ochres, browns and blacks, but the scenes the paintings depict are oddly gay. Priests smile, their hands lifted up high to Amun Ra, offering flower petals in their palms, while a young girl, bedecked in black, stands by watching, a twisted smile on her face."
	.GSTR STR?538,"You are at the top of a steep, descending passage that plunges down to the north. Although the angle is steep, it looks as if you should have firm enough footing to travel safely. From the angle, it appears as though the passage is actually leaving the pyramid, cutting down through the sand high overhead to an adjoining building."
	.GSTR STR?357,"You are at the west edge of an east/west path on the southern side of the encampment. Directly to the west is a heavy growth of thickets, making any attempt at western movement a painful and futile task. Through the thickets you can hear the sound of water running gently by."
	.GSTR STR?307,"You are below the deck of the barge in what looks like a huge hold. To the west you can see the hold continuing, while a ladder leads up and out from here."
	.GSTR STR?371,"You are deep in desert, the encampment little more than a memory. You think for a moment, closing your eyes, trying to picture the coolness of the Nile, the comfort of your cot, and are overcome with doubts. When you open your eyes again you are greeted with the same nightmare: All around you, all you can see for mile after mile is sand and more sand."
	.GSTR STR?377,"You are deep into the desert, as deep as anyone in his right mind would ever care to venture. A small but strong gust of wind reaches your face, pelting you with grains of sand so small they remind you of fine sugar. Even with your lips tightly closed, the wind manages to drive a few grains into your mouth. You are thankful that none got into your eyes."
	.GSTR STR?383,"You are far into the desert, sand and more sand stretching out endlessly around you in all directions. You think of going back, of giving up this attempt at riches, but what awaits you back in the States? What is there worth going back to, with nothing to show for this quest? And how could you go back now, after the things you'd said to Craige? You glance around at the rolling dunes and force back the fear eating away your confidence."
	.GSTR STR?143,"You are in a cubical-room whose walls, floor and ceiling are of an identical size. There are three square doorways cut into the walls -- to the north, to the west, and a newly opened one to the east. Engraved on a wall are some hieroglyphs, while a panel, recessed in the same wall, glows softly in your reflected light."
	.GSTR STR?544,"You are in a huge chamber, immense in its size and scope, especially since it is far underground. Your light seems to climb and fall from the high walls, making their top boundaries undefined as they melt into inky darkness, flickering into the unknown reaches high overhead. There is a huge doorway carved out of the south wall, the arch at its top barely discernible in your light. To the north is a similar doorway, slightly scaled down, with pillars on either side of it, their shadows playing strange tricks on the wall behind them. You can just barely make out the paintings on the walls, pictures of the ancient Queen, her servants, and the priests in attendance."
	.GSTR STR?444,"You are in a room in the shape of a perfect cube. There are three square doorways cut into the walls -- one to the west, one to the east, and another to the south."
	.GSTR STR?451,"You are in a room whose dimensions seem to form a perfect cube. There are two square doorways cut into the walls -- one to the south, and another to the west. This room seems to form a corner for this entire area."
	.GSTR STR?442,"You are in a room whose dimensions seem to measure a perfect cube. On the floor of this room is a series of symbols, inscribed in the stone. The walls bear strange pictures of a Queen, one of which shows her being wrapped in linen, another one showing her being lowered into what appears to be a solid gold sarcophagus. Four identical square doorways lead out of this chamber to the north, south, east and west."
	.GSTR STR?453,"You are in a room whose shape is that of a perfect cube. There are two square doorways cut into the walls -- one to the south, and another to the east."
	.GSTR STR?438,"You are in a room whose symmetry is uncanny, at least to the unaided eye: the dimensions of the room seem to form a perfect cube. There are three square doorways cut into the walls -- one to the north, and another to the west. A wide staircase leads up through the square doorway to the east."
	.GSTR STR?449,"You are in a room whose symmetry is uncanny, at least to the unaided eye: the dimensions of the room seem to form a perfect cube. There are two square doorways cut into the walls -- one to the north, and another to the east. The uncannily-shaped room seems to form a corner for this entire area."
	.GSTR STR?446,"You are in a room whose symmetry is uncanny, at least to the unaided eye: the dimensions of the room seem to form a perfect cube. There are two square doorways cut into the walls -- one to the north, and another to the west. A panel, recessed into a wall, glows softly in your reflected light, while some hieroglyphs are visible above it."
	.GSTR STR?548,"You are in a room whose walls are covered with gold leaf. Your light reflects off the walls with a rich, warm tone and reveals the outlines of hieroglyphics engraved in the gold itself. There is a doorway cut into the south wall and, through the reflected light, you can tell it leads into a small chamber. There is another doorway leading out to the east."
	.GSTR STR?440,"You are in a room whose walls, floor and ceiling seem to form a perfect cube. There are four square doorways cut into the walls -- to the north, the south, the east and the west. Through the west doorway you can see a flight of stairs heading up."
	.GSTR STR?553,"You are in a small alcove off the Golden Room. Sitting in the middle of this small room is a roughly-hewn slab of granite, much like a legless table."
	.GSTR STR?557,"You are in a small alcove off the Silver Room. Sitting in the middle of this small room is a roughly-hewn slab of granite, much like a legless table."
	.GSTR STR?498,"You are in a strange, round room which sits in the center of four hallways. These hallways lead off to the northeast, southeast, southwest and northwest like the spokes of a wheel. Above your head is a long tunnel which stretches up and out of sight."
	.GSTR STR?455,"You are in a strange, turning passageway. The floor here descends, reminding you of a ramp Craige once told you about -- a deep entrance into the depths of an Incan tomb. The ramp turns off toward the north. Judging from what you remember of the cube rooms, the ramp most probably passes beneath the ascending east staircase. Through the open doorway to the west you can still see one of the cube rooms."
	.GSTR STR?365,"You are in a tent which used to house the workers and their personal effects. Looking around, taking in the stripped and bare surroundings, you feel surprised that they even left the canvas walls. You quickly realize that they took what they needed -- taking everything would have been more trouble than it was worth. From the looks of things they cleared out quickly but quietly."
	.GSTR STR?345,"You are in a tent, very much like your own -- a tent which had originally contained the supplies for your expedition. You notice, however, that most of the items which were here just yesterday have vanished with your workers. The tent looks as if it's been cleaned out and, as your stomach growls, the empty tent ironically reminds you of a turkey carcass picked clean after a huge Thanksgiving meal. Through the open tent flaps to the east you can see the firepit. If only one of the workers had remained behind, you would make him pay."
	.GSTR STR?305,"You are in the aft cabin aboard the barge. There's a door to the west which leads out to the deck, and a short ladder, permanently mounted to the deck, going down into the depths of the barge itself."
	.GSTR STR?367,"You are in the broiling sands of the desert, a short distance from the camp. Off to the west you can just make out a slight discoloration in the sand, the start of an east/west path which borders the northern edge of the camp."
	.GSTR STR?351,"You are in the center of the encampment, standing before a charred pit, a hole dug in the sand surrounded by blackened rocks. The night breezes have already started the reclamation work of the desert, covering most of the pit's bottom. You can see your tent to the north, the work tent to the south, and the supply tent to the west. Far off to the east, through the heat waves rising off the shifting sands, you can see gentle, rolling dunes."
	.GSTR STR?228,"You are in the Chamber of Rebirth, the Annex. As you gaze about this small room, strange kohl-rimmed eyes gaze back at you from the painted figures which cover all of the walls. There are scenes of a great procession, with white-clad princesses offering gifts of precious oils and papyri to the mummified figure of the Queen. Bastet, the cat goddess, holds the mummy erect. Above you, painted on the ceiling, is the image of Tueris, the hippopotamus goddess. The only way out is through the doorway to the east."
	.GSTR STR?238,"You are in the Chamber of Reconstitution of the Body, the Treasury. To the west is a doorway leading back into the Burial Chamber."
	.GSTR STR?127,"You are in the desert at a site of successful excavation. Beneath you lies the pyramid, its stone door at last open. The desert is all around you, but down there lie the secrets of the ages."
	.GSTR STR?422,"You are in the desert, a vast wasteland of sand and heat."
	.GSTR STR?61,"You are in the desert, almost out of sight of the encampment to the west. At last, though, you've found the ancient pyramid. The top of the pyramid is clearly exposed and on one of its sides is a square opening."
	.GSTR STR?369,"You are in the desert, almost out of sight of the encampment, your only link with civilization. You are just close enough to make out a tiny dot on the western horizon which could be one of the tents. The searing sand is making walking a difficult and painful experience, something alien to you."
	.GSTR STR?379,"You are in the desert, east of the encampment. From this distance the camp seems little more than a mirage, an image of another reality which has little to do with the brutal, searing reality of the desert, your quickly dehydrating body, or your painfully broiling feet."
	.GSTR STR?381,"You are in the desert, out of sight of the encampment. You are thankful there's no wind, even though a cooling breeze would be welcomed, since the fine sand particles would sting your face and hands. All around is the desert, a sweeping expanse of disheartening sand."
	.GSTR STR?373,"You are in the desert, still within sight of the encampment, just a tiny oasis to the west. The tents, shimmering behind the heat waves rising from the sand, seem to be calling you back, beckoning, offering safety and refuge."
	.GSTR STR?303,"You are in the forward cabin aboard the barge. The cabin is bare with none of the luxuries you expected to see. You close your eyes for a moment, picturing the barge you'll someday own, the yacht fully rigged and crewed. You open your eyes and shake your head, anxious to make your dream reality. There's a doorway to the east leading out onto the deck."
	.GSTR STR?251,"You are in the middle of a long, east/west passage. The passage is narrow and seems to be little more than a hallway hewn out of stone."
	.GSTR STR?217,"You are in the middle of the Chamber of Eternal Royalty, the antechamber. The walls in this section of the antechamber are covered with beveled tiles of deep blue lapis lazuli and pink alabaster. At ceiling height, on the west wall, are paintings depicting the marriage of the goddess Isis and the god Osiris. The Antechamber stretches out to the north and the south. There's just enough light cast for you to see the outline of the bottomless pit in the passage to the east."
	.GSTR STR?559,"You are in the north end of the Chamber of Eternal Royalty. On the eastern and western walls are scenes carved in high relief depicting a royal figure, possibly meant to represent a new ruler, performing the ritual of the ""opening of the mouth and eyes"", the ceremony of restoring to the mummy of the departed Queen the use of its senses. The north wall of this area is a thick, solid wall of stone. In the center of this wall is a timber lintel on top of a doorway."
	.GSTR STR?555,"You are in the Silver Chamber, a room whose walls reflect your light brilliantly due to their silver surface. A doorway leads west and out, while another doorway leads into a smaller room to the south."
	.GSTR STR?291,"You are in the southeast corner of the Barge Chamber. There's enough room to bypass the stern of the barge and continue to the north. To the west you can see the entrance to the barge."
	.GSTR STR?221,"You are in the southern end of the Chamber of Eternal Royalty. From here you can see the room stretching out towards the north. The south wall is painted to resemble large baskets of lotus flowers with their blue petals framing an image of the Sun God, Amun Ra. The west wall has a timber doorway, inset several feet into the rocks, outlining a door."
	.GSTR STR?115,"You are in the southern end of the Chamber of Eternal Royalty. From here you can see the room stretching out towards the north. The south wall is painted to resemble large baskets of lotus flowers with their blue petals framing an image of the Sun God, Amun Ra. The west wall once held a door but is now forever blocked."
	.GSTR STR?289,"You are in the southern section of a huge room which holds the royal barge. Before you, to the north, is a plank which provides entrance to the barge. There is room to move around the barge to the east and west, while a doorway to the southeast leads into a darkened corridor."
	.GSTR STR?546,"You are in the temple's inner chamber. The ceiling here is lower, low enough for your light to reach it. There are openings in the east and west walls, and a large, arched doorway to the south. The walls are covered with paintings, most of which depict the Queen in different stages of preparation for her trip on the royal barge. One in particular, larger than any of the others, shows the Queen and all of her attendants aboard the barge, floating through the air on their way to the netherworld. There are some detailed hieroglyphs on one of the walls."
	.GSTR STR?99,"You are in the west end of the passage. The plaster has been cleared, allowing passage to the west."
	.GSTR STR?309,"You are in the westmost portion of the hold, below the deck of the barge. On the north side of the hull is a small knothole about three feet off the deck. Overhead you can see a hole going through the deck while, directly below this hole, on the deck by your feet, is a slot."
	.GSTR STR?341,"You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little."
	.GSTR STR?518,"You are midway down the Southeast Hallway. This corridor is undecorated and the walls are polished to a smooth lustre. The hallway continues to the southeast and the northwest."
	.GSTR STR?515,"You are midway down the Southwest Hallway. The walls of this narrow passage are unadorned and smooth. The hallway continues to the southwest and the northeast."
	.GSTR STR?283,"You are on a landing in the middle of a set of stairs. The staircase goes down to the south and up to the north. The walls here are undistinguished, formed by the stones of which the pyramid was built."
	.GSTR STR?336,"You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. A path to the south starts here, and you can see the riverbank clearly to the west. A warm, light breeze reaches your face, drying your sweat into a thin mask of salt. You glance to the north and are greeted by a disheartening sight: an endless stretch of searing desert."
	.GSTR STR?339,"You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone."
	.GSTR STR?343,"You are on an east/west path on the northern side of the encampment. To the east you can see the sites of previous excavations your workers had begun before they deserted you. Low, gentle sand dunes roll out of sight to the north, but your camp's eastern border has a path, heading off to the south, which starts here."
	.GSTR STR?361,"You are on an east/west path, directly to the north of the work tent. To the north you can see the firepit and, beyond that, your tent. The work tent borders an endless vista of fine, burning sand stretching out to the south."
	.GSTR STR?329,"You are on the bank of the river Nile. The shoreline is sandy and cool, and reeds wave in a light but warm breeze. Directly to the north and the south thickets make strolling along the bank impossible. You're hot, and the cool rippling water to the west looks inviting, but you're not alone in that thought -- crocodiles bask on the west bank, eyeing you hungrily, just waiting for you to enter their watery domain. Things were never like this when Craige was around."
	.GSTR STR?484,"You are standing in a small room, that of the protective goddess Selkis. There are red, blue and green patterns on the walls formed from small glazed tiles that have been carefully arranged in order of shade. The darkest tiles border the floor, and become lightest near the ceiling. On one wall, inscribed in a beaten gold panel, is the symbol of Selkis, under which you can see some hieroglyphic text. An opening through the southwest wall leads out of this room."
	.GSTR STR?12,"You are standing in the Chamber of Ra, a tribute to the Sun God. Even though the only natural light enters through the opening above, the room is brilliantly lit as though the walls themselves generated light. The room slopes inward and the walls meet at an open point, over your head. The heat of the desert filters down through the opening and, as the air slowly circulates, the deep, long-dead musty odors from the depths of the pyramid assault your senses. Four staircases descend from here: a steep one to the north, a winding one to the south, a wide one to the east, and a narrow one to the west."
	.GSTR STR?508,"You are standing in the middle of the Northwest Hallway. The walls here are smooth and undecorated, carved out of granite. The hallway continues to the northwest and to the southeast."
	.GSTR STR?492,"You are standing in the room of the protective goddess Neith. This room seems dark and mysterious with its decorations of inky-blue lapis lazuli and jet-black obsidian. Gold scrollwork defines an area on one of the walls, in the center of which is the symbol of Neith. Below this you can see some hieroglyphs etched into a beaten gold panel. There is a door in the northwest wall leading out of the room."
	.GSTR STR?512,"You are standing midway down the long Northeast Hallway. The high walls are undecorated, but bear the marks of the stonecarver's tool. The hallway continues to the northeast and the southwest."
	.GSTR STR?301,"You are standing on the deck of an ancient wooden barge. Before you, cut into the deck, is a hole. To the south is a plank which leads down off the barge. You can see two cabins on the deck, one to the west and the other to the east."
	.GSTR STR?375,"You are standing on the top of a sand dune, looking all around at a place on Earth where man was never meant to be. That is the only conclusion you can draw as you force yourself to breathe the hot, arid air of the desert through your nose. Breathing through your mouth makes you instantly thirsty, a dangerous state to find yourself in while surrounded by sand. You curse Craige, then find yourself cursing Ellingsworth, too."
	.GSTR STR?527,"You are two steps down the steep staircase when you see before you a deep dropoff going down into nothingness. To go down any further would be suicide."
	.GSTR STR?447,"You can't go that way."
	.GSTR STR?149,"You fall over on your face as a quick-acting poison from the ring makes its way to your heart. Bye!"
	.GSTR STR?159,"You fall over on your face, dreaming of Thanksgiving dinner. Needless to say, it was you against hunger. And hunger won."
	.GSTR STR?166,"You grasp the rope firmly in your hands, but the fall is shorter than you thought. You reach the bottom with a resounding splat accompanied by a chorus of pain led by ganglions you never knew you had. Just before you (thankfully) black out, you release your grip from the rope."
	.GSTR STR?476,"You have entered the room of the protective goddess Nephthys. The walls here are cut from pink granite, elaborately decorated with bright red carnelian and pale yellow feldspar. Along the northeast wall are panels of beaten gold, and midway up this wall, under the winged symbol of Nephthys, you can see some hieroglyphs. To the southeast, an opening has been cut in the thick granite wall."
	.GSTR STR?253,"You have reached the west end of the passage. Before you is a door surrounded by a heavy timber frame. The door is entirely blocked up with plaster. Toward the bottom of the north wall and the south wall, about three inches off the floor, are two small niches. There are some hieroglyphs on the plaster."
	.GSTR STR?642,"You hear a whirring overhead and look up in time to see a gyrocopter settling to the sand on the horizon."
	.GSTR STR?88,"you lose your balance on the mast. Your foot misses the mast and you slip, falling into the darkness below."
	.GSTR STR?74,"You manage to destroy the seal, but as you stand in the doorway, you hear the distinct sound of grinding stone. You glance to your right and see fine sand running from a crack in the wall. You're totally unaware of the 3 tons of carved stone block falling onto your head from directly above."
	.GSTR STR?2,"You manage to wade a few feet into the river, but this makes the crocodiles spring into action -- they advance far more quickly than you thought possible. You panic and turn to the bank, attempting to flee. Your splashing about makes the beasts double their efforts and reach you just as you are about to step on shore. The last thought you have is a slight amazement at how many teeth a crocodile has and just how sharp they are.[ID: verbs:2392]"
	.GSTR STR?101,"You open the door but before you can react, two huge stones close in on you -- one from the left side and one from the right side. Needless to say, you didn't quite make it..."
	.GSTR STR?358,"You scratch yourself on the thickets as you attempt this.[ID: camp:471]"
	.GSTR STR?359,"You scratch yourself on the thickets as you attempt this.[ID: camp:472]"
	.GSTR STR?90,"You should have left well enough alone. As you pick it up, the discs go wildly out of balance and, before you realize what you've done, the ceiling comes down to meet the floor. Unfortunately, you were between them at the time."
	.GSTR STR?607,"You should have looked before you leaped."
	.GSTR STR?83,"You step into air then plummet into a deep pit, the home of a rat pack."
	.GSTR STR?11,"You take a few steps down the steep staircase when suddenly you lose your footing as you try to walk on air. You fall a mere 25 feet straight down and, landing on your head, regret your attempt.[ID: ra:65]"
	.GSTR STR?643,"You think you see a spaceship settling on the horizon and, as you strain your eyes through the wafting waves of heat, you see a man and a huge robot. You can almost hear them saying ""Gort, Klaatu Barada Nikto."""
	.GSTR STR?0,"You wake slowly, sit up in your bunk, look around the tent, and try to ignore the pounding in your head, the cottony taste in your mouth, and the ache in your stomach. The droning of a plane's engine breaks the stillness and you realize that things outside are quiet -- too quiet. You know that this can mean only one thing: your workmen have deserted you. They complained over the last few weeks, grumbling about the small pay and lack of food, and your inability to locate the pyramid. And after what you stupidly did yesterday, trying to make them work on a holy day, their leaving is understandable.

The Professor's map was just an ancient map -- as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long-overdue box."
	.GSTR STR?651,"You wipe your sweating brow, gazing off into the distance, and notice a cool, crystal-clear lake glimmering on the horizon, just to the north."
	.GSTR STR?299,"You're at the start of a hallway which goes off to the north. To the south, directly behind you, is the back side of the barge. There's enough room to get around it to the east and west."
	.GSTR STR?297,"You're in the northwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can see by your light that there's room enough to continue around the back of the barge by going to the east, while you can bypass the bow of the boat by going south."
	.GSTR STR?295,"You're in the southwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can still see the barge entrance to the east, while there's enough room to continue to the north, around the barge."
	.GSTR STR?618,"You're knee-deep in the hole, digging away, taking out more and more sand. You silently curse those workers for having deserted you."
	.GSTR STR?347,"You're on a north/south path on the west edge of the encampment. Directly to the west is the supply tent, its flaps open, still in the hot, quiet air. To the east you can see the central firepit, a reminder of your being alone. A row of thickets, impossible to make any progress through even with a machete, grows along the western edge of the camp directly to the north and south of the tent."
	.GSTR STR?293,"You're standing in the northeast corner of the Barge Chamber. You can get around the stern of the barge to the south, while there's enough room to continue around the barge to the west."
	.GSTR STR?615,"You've dug a small hole. As you stand there and watch it, the sand starts to fill it in a little."
	.GSTR STR?619,"You've dug yourself into a deep hole. You're actually several feet below the surrounding sand. The walls look very unstable.[ID: verbs:1860]"
	.GSTR STR?616,"You've enlarged the hole a little, taking out two shovelsfull for every one that collapses back in from the walls."
	.GSTR STR?617,"You've made the hole quite sizable, though it's not very deep. The deeper you dig, the more the walls collapse and so you widen the base of the hole."
	.GSTR STR?86,"your foot lands on empty space and you plummet downward to darkness."
