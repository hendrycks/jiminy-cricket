carved out of the south wall, the arch at its top barely discernible in your
light. To the north is a similar doorway, slightly scaled down, with pillars on
either side of it, their shadows playing strange tricks on the wall behind
them. You can just barely make out the paintings on the walls, pictures of the
ancient Queen, her servants, and the priests in attendance.")
