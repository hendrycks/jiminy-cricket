Near the glass arch is a small rectangular brick structure. The center of the structure is a hole about a foot wide, leading down into darkness."
	.GSTR STR?514,"The opening in the brick structure is too small for humans or even bats."
	.GSTR STR?284,"The personal journal of Belboz the Necromancer is lying here."

	.GSTR STR?383,"The river bed ends here at a steep cliff, where the river once plunged over a waterfall. Below the falls, in the distance, is a large sea, covered with haze. The bed continues northwest, but the banks here are unclimbable. Atop the southwestern bank stands a proud fortress."
	.GSTR STR?381,"The river bed to the northwest is a pool covered with algae and other scum. The bed to the southeast is slightly drier. The banks are too tall and steep to climb here."
	.GSTR STR?586,"The river is too wide to cross."

	.GSTR STR?434,"The tunnel turns a corner here. You could go either north or east."
	.GSTR STR?496,"The underground road ends here. A hovel, carved into the rock, lies to the east. To the north, wide marble stairs lead upward."

	.GSTR STR?219,"The vines encircle you and tear you limb from limb."
	.GSTR STR?526,"The walls and ceiling of this room are covered with soot and held up by timbers which don't look very sturdy. A winding tunnel leads north. From the east comes a sulfurous odor."
	.GSTR STR?182,"The waxer short circuits in the water, electrocuting you and several nearby fishies."
	.GSTR STR?505,"There is a marble statue here, in a strikingly life-like pose of pompous bellicosity."
	.GSTR STR?566,"There's a tall cliff there."
	.GSTR STR?592,"This cavern is of extraordinary size, but nevertheless crowded with powerful-looking machinery. You recognize a breeder for producing millions of the mutated grues you just passed. Other devices seem designed to aid the forces of evil while sapping magic powers of Enchanters everywhere.

At the far end of the cavern are three closed doors: a black marble door leading to the northwest, a shiny silver door heading due west, and a door of bleached white wood to the southwest."
	.GSTR STR?459,"This is a battlement with a view of a river to the north and an ocean to the east. Openings northwest, west, and southwest lead to other parts of the fort."
	.GSTR STR?331,"This is a closet for storage. The only exit is east."
	.GSTR STR?432,"This is a featureless tunnel, narrowing to the west. To the east is a deep gorge, probably too wide to jump across."
	.GSTR STR?361,"This is a flat and featureless dirt path leading north and south."
	.GSTR STR?482,"This is a huge tent filled with hectic noise, blinking lights, and the smell of frying food. Near the exit is a game booth lined with prizes. The concept of the game seems to be bashing cute little mechanical bunnies with a rubber ball as they hop around a little artificial meadow."
	.GSTR STR?402,"This is a large and well-equipped torture chamber. These were very popular in castles of several centuries ago, but are somewhat out of fashion now. There are exits to the west and north."
	.GSTR STR?502,"This is a large entrance hall, paved with polished stone. Large doorways lead north and south."
	.GSTR STR?303,"This is a large hall where the Guild's young apprentices live and study as they strive to achieve a seat on the Circle. You think back to the days when you occupied these quarters. The apprentices are gone, having accompanied Frobar into town to shop. You can leave to the southeast."
	.GSTR STR?491,"This is a large, plush room, slightly neglected."
	.GSTR STR?589,"This is a low, shadowy cave leading east to west. The rocky walls are scarred with deep claw marks."
	.GSTR STR?441,"This is a meandering north-south tunnel. A side passage leads to the southwest."
	.GSTR STR?367,"This is a moist room whose walls are thick with moss and lichens. A small hole leads up and a rocky passage leads south."
	.GSTR STR?565,"This is a narrow beach between a small cove to the east and tall cliffs to the west. The shore curves to the southeast and northeast. A metal chute leads up into the cliff."
	.GSTR STR?499,"This is a small underground hovel. On the far wall is a small fireplace, long unused."
	.GSTR STR?301,"This is a sparsely furnished living area for the servants of the Guild. None are in sight; presumably they are out doing their daily errands. You can leave to the southwest."
	.GSTR STR?430,"This is a strip of land to the east of a gaping chasm. You might try jumping across, but I'd advise against it. A wide crater lies to the east."
	.GSTR STR?323,"This is a study chamber for members of the Guild. Usually, there would be several elder Enchanters patiently training novices, but no one is here at the moment. The only exit is west.
Lying open on a stand in one corner is a heavy volume, probably a copy of the Encyclopedia Frobizzica."
	.GSTR STR?436,"This is a tall room flooded with light from an unseen source. The only exit is south."
	.GSTR STR?413,"This is a wide road winding away to the east and west, perhaps a relic of the Great Underground Empire you read about in history class. A passage leads up to the north."
	.GSTR STR?422,"This is an appliance store, apparently abandoned. The entrance lies to the north."
	.GSTR STR?528,"This is obviously the heart of a large coal mine, illuminated by a wall-mounted lamp. The bottom of a metal coal chute is visible at the north end of the room. Another chute continues downward at the southern end. A large coal bin is overflowing, and the floor is completely covered with lumps of coal. A passage leads east, but a western passage is blocked by rubble."
	.GSTR STR?408,"This is the dark and dank dungeon of the ruined castle. There's probably a torture chamber nearby. You can go east, northeast, or upward. A small opening leads down as well."
	.GSTR STR?314,"This is the entrance lobby of the Guild Hall. Befitting the status and wealth of the Guild, the lobby is finished with polished Antharian marble, inlaid with intricate patterns of silver leaf. To the north is a wide arch, and smaller openings flank the area on the eastern and western sides, as well as the northeastern and northwestern corners. A narrow stair leads downward. Through another arch to the south, you can see the entrance steps and the main road into town."
	.GSTR STR?576,"This is the floor of a cove off the turbulent ocean to the east. The ground slopes upward to the north, west, and south. Light filters down from the surface of the water."
	.GSTR STR?400,"This is the only turret of the castle still standing. It affords a marvelous view of a meadow to the west, and beyond that a twisted forest. To the north is a mighty fortress which stands atop a cliff where a turbulent river pours into an ocean. The ocean stretches out of sight to the east. A spiralling staircase leads downward."
	.GSTR STR?293,"This is the room of Frobar the Enchanter. There isn't much here in the way of furnishings, Frobar being a pretty dull kind of guy."
	.GSTR STR?601,"This is your chamber in the Hall of the Guild of Enchanters, with a doorway to the west. A private chamber is a great privilege, especially for an Enchanter as young as yourself, but how many Enchanters can say they defeated the infamous Krill?"
	.GSTR STR?468,"This looks like the entrance to a run-down amusement park, no longer gaudy with lights and glitter. A sign above the entrance proclaims ""Welcome to Bozbarland - The Entertainment Capital of the Empire."" The park lies to the west and a tunnel leads northeast."
	.GSTR STR?596,"This room is filled with blinding light that stabs at your eyes."
	.GSTR STR?556,"This small room has a slanted roof, presumably due to the coal chute which passes overhead. You can reenter the chute to the east."
	.GSTR STR?695,"This tea is cold! Get me another cup."
	.GSTR STR?457,"This was a barracks for the battalion stationed in this fort. You could leave to the south, or to the southeast."
	.GSTR STR?50,"This was not a safe place to try jumping. You should have looked before you leaped."
	.GSTR STR?673,"thrice"
	.GSTR STR?508,"Through a breathtaking archway of glass to the east is an area glistening with reflected light. Another exit leads south."
	.GSTR STR?91,"throw"
	.GSTR STR?357,"To the west, a path enters the blighted woods, which stretch out of sight. A signpost stands beside another path leading north, and to the east is a wide meadow. At the base of the signpost is a slimy hole leading down."

An incredibly old man with a long white beard spots you. ""Fertilize!"" he cries, pointing a slightly bent wand at you. You turn into a pile of bat guano, a fitting end for a trespasser."
	.GSTR STR?197,"You appear in an amusement park game booth. The point of the game is to pierce balloons with darts. Speaking of points, you are suddenly pierced by 37 flying darts."
	.GSTR STR?105,"You appear in the woods behind the Guild Hall. The servants (who should be doing their daily chores) are lazing about, drinking ale and betting on games of Gabber Tumper. To prevent you from reporting their goofing off, they cut your throat. You just can't get good help these days."

	.GSTR STR?448,"You are at the center of a level field inside the fort. Entrances to rooms around the perimeter lie in several directions."
	.GSTR STR?472,"You are at the eastern end of a long midway. The park entrance lies to the east, and rides lie to the north and south."
	.GSTR STR?446,"You are at the entrance to Fort Griffspotter, which lies to the east. A trail leads along the river bank to the northwest."
