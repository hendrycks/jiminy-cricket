This is the interior of a huge temple of primitive construction. A few flickering torches cast a sallow illumination over the altar, which is still drenched with the blood of human sacrifice. Behind the altar is an enormous statue of a demon which seems to reach towards you with dripping fangs and razor-sharp talons. A low noise begins behind you, and you turn to see hundreds of hunched and hairy shapes. A guttural chant issues from their throats. Near you stands a figure draped in a robe of deepest black, brandishing a huge sword. The chant grows louder as the robed figure approaches the altar. The large figure spots you and approaches menacingly. It reaches into its cloak and pulls out a great, glowing dagger. It pulls you onto the altar and, with a murmur of approval from the throng, slices you neatly across your abdomen."

There are chests containing precious jewels, mountains of zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.

On one wall is an annotated map of the Empire, showing the locations of various troves of treasure, and of many superior scenic views.

On a desk at the far end of the room are stock certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.

	.GSTR STR?276,"This is a particularly damp spot even by dungeon standards. You can see the junction to the west, and two similar passages to the east and northeast. A wide stone channel steeply descends into the room from the south. It is covered with slippery moss and lichen. The channel crosses the room, but the opening where it once continued north is now blocked by rubble."
	.GSTR STR?470,"This is a rather wide room. On one side is the bottom of a narrow wooden ladder. To the west and the south are passages leaving the room."
	.GSTR STR?427,"This is a small balcony carved into a near-vertical cliff. To the east, stretching from north to south, stands a monumental aqueduct supported by mighty stone pillars, some of which are starting to crumble from age. You feel a sense of loss and sadness as you ponder this once-proud structure and the failure of the Empire which created this and other engineering marvels. Some stone steps lead up to the northwest."
	.GSTR STR?479,"This is a small chamber carved out of the rock at the end of a short crawl. On the wall is crudely chiseled the number ""8"". The only apparent exit, to the east, seems to be a blur and a loud, whirring sound resounds through the rock."
	.GSTR STR?328,"This is a very low and narrow passage leading east to west."

	.GSTR STR?413,"You are at the base of a steep cliff. Directly above you is a wide ledge and far above that some natural sunlight can be seen. To the northeast is a steeply climbing path and the ground becomes sandy toward the south."
	.GSTR STR?403,"You are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its way upward beyond your vision. An eerie light, coming from all around you, casts strange shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding trail."

	.GSTR STR?433,"You are below the surface of the lake. It turns out that the lake is quite shallow and the bottom is only a few feet below you. Considering the frigid temperature of the water, you should probably not plan an extended stay. The lake bottom is sandy and a few hearty plants and algae live there."

	.GSTR STR?559,"You are dead."
	.GSTR STR?430,"You are floating on the surface of the lake. The water is ice cold and your ability to survive here for long is very questionable. A swim north puts you at your starting point.

	.GSTR STR?372,"You are in a dark and quite creepy crawlway with passages leaving to the north, east, south, and southwest."
	.GSTR STR?380,"You are in a dark and shadowy land. All around you are gentle hills and eerie shadows. Far above, shrouded in mist, you can barely make out the ceiling of the enormous cavern that spans this entire land."
	.GSTR STR?390,"You are in a land of dark shadows and shallow hills, which stretch out in all directions. To the west, the land dips sharply."
	.GSTR STR?377,"You are in a shadowy land of low, rolling hills stretching out to the west and south. The land is bordered to the north by a massive stone wall. Ancient and weathered, the wall has crumbled enough at one point to permit passage."
	.GSTR STR?423,"You are in a wide cavern on the north shore of a small lake. Some polished stone steps lead to the southeast and a sheer rock face prevents any movement around the lake to the southwest. The cavern is dimly lit from above."
	.GSTR STR?495,"You are in a wide stone channel, part of the water supply system for the Great Underground Empire. The source of water was a waterfall to the south, which has long since dried up. Water flowed along the aqueduct to the north. This region is lit from above, although the source of light is not apparent."
	.GSTR STR?382,"You are in an ominously dark land of rolling hills. The ground becomes softer to the south."
	.GSTR STR?564,"You are in perfect health."
	.GSTR STR?388,"You are near the southern end of the land of shadow. The ground here is soft and spongy, and it becomes quicksand to the south. North and east of here are gentle, rolling hills. A gentle sea breeze wafts over a steeply sloping path to the west."
	.GSTR STR?486,"You are on the south shore of the lake. Rock formations prevent movement to the west and thickening swamp to the east makes the going all but impossible. To the south, where the beach meets a rock formation, you can make out a dark passage sloping steeply upward into the rock."
	.GSTR STR?436,"You are on the western shore of the lake. The ground here is quite hard, but a few sickly reeds manage to grow near the water's edge. The only path leads into the rock to the south."
	.GSTR STR?480,"You are repelled from the exit by a fierce wind."
	.GSTR STR?392,"You are standing atop a steep cliff, looking west over a vast ocean. Far below, the surf pounds at a sandy beach. To the south and east are rolling hills filled with eerie shadows. A path cut into the face of the cliff descends toward the beach. To the north is a tall stone wall, which ends at the cliff edge. It was obviously built long ago, and directly north is a spot where you could climb over the rubble of the decaying wall."
	.GSTR STR?565,"you are surrounded by heavily armed guards who seem awed by your presence. One, whose IQ might be 15, aims a strange waffle-like instrument in your direction and all goes black.[ID: actions:2842]"
	.GSTR STR?560,"You are very seriously wounded. One more wound would very likely do you in."
	.GSTR STR?408,"You are west of the junction, where the rock-bound passage widens out into a large, flat area. Although the land here is barren, you can see vegetation to the west. South of here is a mighty wall of stone, ancient and crumbling. To the southwest the wall has decayed enough to form an opening, through which seeps a thin mist. A trail dips sharply into rocky terrain to the northwest."

	.GSTR STR?563,"You are wounded lightly. You have a good deal of strength in reserve."

	.GSTR STR?475,"You cannot fit through this passage with that load."
	.GSTR STR?588,"You charge, but the hooded figure jumps nimbly aside."
	.GSTR STR?593,"You dodge as the hooded figure comes in low."
	.GSTR STR?195,"You enter the quicksand and slowly sink to a new low in adventuring."
	.GSTR STR?188,"You execute a perfect swan dive into the rocks below!"
	.GSTR STR?131,"You experience a period of disorientation. The area around you seems to be solidifying! Rock formations close in on you and you become engulfed in stone!"
	.GSTR STR?562,"You have a few wounds, which do not seriously impair your strength."
	.GSTR STR?472,"You have come to a dead end in the mine.
There is a small pile of coal here."
	.GSTR STR?274,"You have come to the end of two adjoining passages to the west and the northwest."
	.GSTR STR?606,"You see a passage cluttered with broken timbers. An extremely narrow opening can be seen at the end of the room."
	.GSTR STR?567,"you see a row of military people who, if appearances do not deceive, have the cumulative intelligence of an unripe grapefruit. One of them aims a waffle-shaped implement in your direction and you become numb and then paralyzed and then dead.[ID: actions:2850]"
	.GSTR STR?607,"You see a tiny room with rough walls. Chiseled crudely on one wall is the number ""8"". The only apparent exit seems to be a blur."
	.GSTR STR?608,"You see a wide room with two nearly identical passages leading east and northeast. A wide channel descends steeply into the room and seems to be blocked by rubble."
	.GSTR STR?609,"You see the interior of a huge temple rudely constructed of basalt blocks. Flickering torches cast a sallow illumination over an altar still wet with the blood of human sacrifice, its velvet covers stained and encrusted with gore."
	.GSTR STR?179,"You should have looked before you leaped."
	.GSTR STR?289,"You would be burned to a crisp in no time."
	.GSTR STR?597,"Your friend at the cliff top has started pacing nervously around."
	.GSTR STR?584,"Your move was not quick enough and misses the mark."
	.GSTR STR?325,"Your old friend, the brass lantern, is at your feet."
	.GSTR STR?591,"Your quick reflexes cannot stop the hooded figure's stroke! You are hit!"
