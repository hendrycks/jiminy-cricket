The Circle gathers and its leader, the esteemed Belboz, reveals to them an ancient document which portends evil days much like our own.

""Krill's evil must be unmade,"" he begins, ""but to send a powerful Enchanter is ill-omened. It would be ruinous to reveal oversoon our full powers."" A ripple of concern spreads over the face of each Enchanter. Belboz pauses, and collects his resolve. ""Have hope! This has been written by a hand far wiser than mine!""

He recites a short spell and you appear. Belboz approaches, transfixing you with his gaze, and hands you the document. The other Enchanters await his decree. ""These words, written ages ago, can have only one meaning. You, a novice Enchanter with but a few simple spells in your Book, must seek out Krill, explore the Castle he has overthrown, and learn his secrets. Only then may his vast evil be lessened or, with good fortune, destroyed.""

The Circle rises and intones a richly woven spell, whose many textures imbue the small, darkened chamber with warmth and hope. There is a surge of power; you are Sent."
