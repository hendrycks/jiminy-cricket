	.GSTR STR?643,"You are at Point Lookout, a small, high cliff that affords a spectacular view of the sea. The cliff bottom is dangerous, so the only safe path is the northwest footpath back to the Ocean Road."
	.GSTR STR?837,"You are at the bow of a steel ship that has been here for quite a while. The deck continues aft, and there is a passage leading down at your feet."
	.GSTR STR?836,"You are at the bow of an old, rotting wreck where a ladder leads down through a large square hole in the deck. When the ship sank, the top of one of the masts broke off and fell into the hole. What's left of the deck continues aft."
	.GSTR STR?544,"You are at the north end of the Ocean Road, a narrow north/south road on the east edge of the island. The Wharf Road starts to the northwest, and a back alley starts off to the southwest."
	.GSTR STR?842,"You are at the stern of this wreck. The deck continues forward."
	.GSTR STR?573,"You are at the top of the stairs in the Red Boar. Your room is to the south, and other rooms line the hall. The lighting in the hallway is dim and drab like the wallpaper and carpeting."
	.GSTR STR?554,"You are at the west end of the east/west Shore Road, with the ferry landing to the west. To the north is an impenetrable field, while the south is bordered by the ocean. You can see the mainland in the distance."
	.GSTR STR?444,"You are awakened by what feels like your ship running aground. You are put back to a permanent sleep by the Weasel's knife."
	.GSTR STR?547,"You are halfway along the Ocean Road, with the start of an alley off to the northwest. An empty field lies to your west, and the dangerous ocean shore lies off to your east."
	.GSTR STR?850,"You are in a bunk-lined cabin. The forward bulkhead has an open doorway in it, and a ladder leads down through the deck. The rotting interior of the hull lies aft."
	.GSTR STR?561,"You are in a narrow alley. To the north is the back door of McGinty Salvage, as well as a small window. An overgrown field lies to the south."
	.GSTR STR?677,"You are in a small, cramped cabin decorated with a table and a few chairs. To the aft is the captain's cabin, while the galley lies forward. A ladder leading down goes into the engine room."
	.GSTR STR?567,"You are in an alley behind Outfitters International. An abandoned field lies to the south."
	.GSTR STR?565,"You are in an east/west alley. To the north is a vacant lot, and an overgrown field lies to the south."
	.GSTR STR?641,"You are in Mariners' Trust, the Island's bank. In it are a table and a teller's window. You can see the safe beyond, and it looks pretty empty."
	.GSTR STR?704,"You are in the captain's cabin. A large and comfortable-looking bunk is one of the many comforts in the cabin. The forward doorway leads to the crew's lounge."
	.GSTR STR?680,"You are in the captain's cabin. There is a large and comfortable-looking bunk here. The forward doorway leads to the crew's lounge."
	.GSTR STR?702,"You are in the crew's lounge, a cramped cabin with little more than a table and a few chairs. To aft is the captain's cabin, while the galley lies forward. A ladder leads into the engine room."
	.GSTR STR?596,"You are in the McGinty Salvage office, a concern whose main business is salvaging wrecks. The place is a mess, and the floor is littered with chewed-on cigar stubs. To the north lies the Wharf Road. You can't help feeling uncomfortable here."
	.GSTR STR?839,"You are now aft of midships on the topmost deck. The deck continues fore and aft."
	.GSTR STR?841,"You are on the aft deck of the ship. Passengers could have gathered here to sun themselves and sip drinks. Those times are long gone. The only way to proceed is forward."
	.GSTR STR?840,"You are on the narrowing aft deck of the ship, which continues forward. A hole at the base of one mast leads down."
	.GSTR STR?710,"You are on the ocean floor. Sediment and seaweed wave slowly with the current."
	.GSTR STR?690,"You are on the port side of the Night Wind. The wheelhouse is to starboard. The teak deck is very well-kept. The ocean lies off to port."
	.GSTR STR?537,"You are on the Wharf Road where the wharf starts up to the north. The former site of Outfitters International's warehouse fronts the south side of the road."
	.GSTR STR?534,"You are on the Wharf Road, with the McGinty Salvage office to the south. The ocean lies to the north, its brine smell strong and refreshing."
	.GSTR STR?601,"You are standing on the former site of the Outfitters International warehouse, which burned down a few months back. To the north is the Wharf Road and an alley is to the south."
	.GSTR STR?852,"You can go aft from this cabin, a small and claustrophobic area little more than a widened passageway, or through a jagged hole in the port bulkhead."
	.GSTR STR?548,"You can't get through the weeds."
	.GSTR STR?410,"You can't help notice that your dresser has been opened and the contents messed up."
	.GSTR STR?219,"You fall asleep and run out of air."
	.GSTR STR?182,"You find that diving here is a bad idea without the proper equipment."
	.GSTR STR?184,"You find that the lack of oxygen you quickly encounter is fatally frustrating."
	.GSTR STR?186,"You find the water here too shallow for diving."
	.GSTR STR?461,"You find yourself gasping for air, but there's none to breathe!"
	.GSTR STR?499,"You keep your money in it."
	.GSTR STR?38,"You pass out and never find that you've been mugged, rolled and killed."
	.GSTR STR?95,"You suddenly bump into something in the darkness. You find that this something has long, sharp teeth that feel uncomfortable when they enter your body."
	.GSTR STR?471,"You suddenly find Red's hands around your throat as he makes a comment about hating cowards and Hevlin being wrong."
	.GSTR STR?340,"You suddenly find yourself inhaling water! The airhose trailing behind must have torn, and there's no time to do anything about it!"
	.GSTR STR?324,"You take the suit off and quickly realize you're not a dolphin. You realize this too late, though."
	.GSTR STR?569,"You're at the east end of an east/west alley. The back door of The Shanty is to the north, and an overgrown field is to the south. Narrow paths to the northeast and southeast lead to the Ocean Road."
	.GSTR STR?558,"You're at the west end of an east/west alley. The back entrance to the Red Boar Inn is to the north, and an overgrown field is to the south."
	.GSTR STR?856,"You're in one of the large holds of the ship, impressive in size. There are rooms fore and aft, and a hole in the port bulkhead."
	.GSTR STR?576,"You're in your room in the Red Boar Inn. It's sparsely furnished, but comfortable enough. To the north is the door, and there's a closet without a door to the west."
	.GSTR STR?542,"You're on the east end of Wharf Road. The Ocean Road starts here and parallels the island's east edge, heading to the southeast. The Shanty is to the south."
	.GSTR STR?686,"You're out to sea now.[ID: boat:1039]"
	.GSTR STR?687,"You're out to sea now.[ID: boat:1040]"
	.GSTR STR?657,"You're out to sea now.[ID: boat:196]"
	.GSTR STR?658,"You're out to sea now.[ID: boat:197]"
	.GSTR STR?467,"You've used all your air."
	.GSTR STR?345,"Your airhose catches and tears on the way down."
	.GSTR STR?446,"Your boat is lost in a sudden squall while you sleep."
	.GSTR STR?299,"your money"
	.GSTR STR?298,"Your pleasant leap is interrupted as you find yourself impaled on the jagged rocks."
