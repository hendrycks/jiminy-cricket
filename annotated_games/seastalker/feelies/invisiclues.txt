  C. But it's very hard to hear her...
  D. ...because there is no Friendly Mermaid in this game. Remember, some of
     these questions and answers are fakes. Don't assume the absence or
     presence of a question means it's important. Also don't assume long

     MOUNT DART GUN ON SUB.

What about the "49er" Prospecting Bazooka?
  A. A bazooka seems as if it might come in handy.
  B. There are several ways to mount the bazooka on the Scimitar.
  C. One way is to find the bazooka. Take it and mount it on the claw of the
     Scimitar yourself.
  D. Or, when Commander Bly asks you if you can think of any high-powered
     weapon, tell her about the bazooka.  Get the bazooka, then tell
     Commander Bly to mount it on the Scimitar.

How do I know when I'm ready to leave the Aquadome?
     Commander Bly will ask you if you are ready to take off.

What does the fine grid do?
  A. The fine grid will show objects within 25 meters of the Scimitar. The
     regular sonar shows objects within 2,500 meters.
  B. Having the fine grid installed will give you a better picture of
     objects very near the Scimitar, like the Snark.

  C. One way to stop him is to close the docking tank roof when he first
     appears on the station monitor.
  D. Another way is to turn off the docking tank electricity.
  E. Another way to stop Bill is to flood the docking tank before he enters
     the Scimitar.

  B. Flood the tank, open the gate, start the engine, open the throttle and
     go south.


THE BATTLE
**********

Where's the Snark?
  A. Try asking Commander Bly.
  B. Or any of the crew members.
  C. Go southeast from the Aquadome.

I have spotted a cloud of silt ahead. Should I continue?
  A. It might be the Snark. Are you prepared to deal with it?
  B. Yes, you should continue.
  C. Besides, you don't have any choice.

How did Sharon get in the Sea Cat?
  A. Hitch-hiked?
  B. Dr.Thorpe picked her up at the Research Lab.

Is Sharon a traitor?
  A. She opened the circuit breaker, didn't she?
  B. She left the catalyst capsule out of the Scimitar, didn't she?
  C. And now she is in the Sea Cat with the man who is trying to kill you.
     What do you think?
  D. Try saying something to her over the sonarphone.
  E. Of course she isn't a traitor. She was just playing along with Dr.
     Thorpe in the hopes of stopping him.

Is Tip a traitor?
  A. Tip, your good buddy, pal, and friend -- a traitor?
  B. Tip, who has stood by you in this game while you killed both yourself
     and him many times, a traitor?
  C. No way. You should be ashamed of yourself for even developing the
     answers to this question.
  D. You owe Tip an apology.

Am I a traitor?
  A. Why are you wasting your developing fluid on this answer?
  B. Go ahead and develop, there's plenty of fluid.
  C. And plenty more dumb answers.
  D. See?!
  E. You can stop now.
  F. Some people never learn!
  G. Absolutely never!!!

Why can't I get around the Snark?
  A. Are the Snark and the Sea Cat moving too fast?
  B. Maybe you should move faster.
  C. Try setting the throttle to medium.
  D. Better yet, try setting the throttle to fast.

What should I do with the dart?
  A. You could tranquilize the Snark.
  B. Or maybe that isn't such a good idea.
  C. If you tranquilize the Snark, there won't be much to stop Dr. Thorpe
     from blasting you with his rocket.

What should I do with the bazooka?
  A. You could try shooting the Snark.
  B. But the Snark has tremendous scientific value, so it would be a waste
     to shoot it.
  C. Another good reason not to shoot the Snark with the bazooka is that
     then Dr. Thorpe will have a clear shot at you!
  D. So why not shoot the Sea Cat's power pod and disable it?
