The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C. 20500
Dear Friend,
Congratulations on your election into the Discovery
Squad! I knew that one day you wouldjoin the ranks
of this elite group of inventors. Everyone here in
Washington is happy for you. But I'm wondering, how
are you going to make the acceptance ceremony next
week if you're right in the middle of testing your new
sub, the Scimitar? Awards on Monday, submarine
launch on Tuesday-you must not get much rest!

In any case, I'm not going to be able to fly in for the
Scimitar's christening because I have to be in China
for some diplomatic business. But, after you've finiShed
your first mission, heaven knows what it might be,
my wife and I would like you to come to the White
House for a visit. She's never met anyone from the
Discovery Squad before, and she's really looking forward
to entertaining a true American hero.
Once again,
Congratulations,
The President

Inventions Unlimited
Personnel file
TIP RANDALL- Tip is your closest pal and constant companion.
Basically, there's nothing this guy can't do. He's
an expert pilot, submariner, surfer, and swimmer. He's
more of a jock than an inventor such as yourself, but his
bulldog courage and rollicking high spirits make him a
gre,it companion in any adventure.
COMMANDER ZOEBLY-This woman's delicate beauty is
hard to resist but when you sLlrt to talk to her-wow,
what a tough one she is. For one thing, she's a champion
athlete and a superachiever. For the past three months
now, she's been commander at the Aquadome, She's an
honor graduate of the Navy Frogman School and the
Galley institute of Technology. You'll see soon enough
that she doesn't have much patience with people who
don't meet her standards. And that attitude tends to
make some people real mad.
MICK ANTRIM- Mick was probably out earning a buck
before most of us were even born. In fact, you won't find
anybody who knows more about nuclear power, undersea
navigation, or communications. That's pretty good for a
guy who never had a formal education. But Mick doesn't
like to settle arguments with his tongue; he'd rather use
his fists. Naturally. he doesn't take well to Commander
Bly's kind of discipline.
MARV SIEGEL-This guy knows more about sonar gear
than anyone at Inventions Unlimited. His experience
comes from having worked for the Defense Department.
He fits in well with his co-workers at the Aquadome, and
he's even learned how to scuba dive.
BILL GRENUP-Bill comes from a different background
altogether. l'iasica!ly he used to be a beach bum with a
knack tor scuba diving and "shade tree" mechanic work.
Now he's joined society in a big way. He's cut his hair
and Found himself a job as a crack scuba diver at the
Aquadorne.

WALT "DOC" HORKVAK
Walt's probably the most dedicated
scientist around, so dedicated that sometimes you
get the impression he's a loner. He's always working on
some new experiment or scuba diving. Walt doesn't look
like the "doctor" type, but he spent a lot of time working
in a hospital before he got interested in marine biochemis·
try. lf you're looking for any kind of medical advice, he's
the one to ask.
SHARON KEMP-She's fresh out of college-the Massa·
chusetts Institute of Technology. Naturally, she's pretty
familiar with all types of science and technology, and
this job as an inventor's assistant fits her well. Her father
was a famous college professor and an old friend ot
your father's. In fact, sometimes you get the feeling that
she's your own sister. But there's something about her
that you just can't get close to.
AMY LOWELL-She's a Navy woman through and
through. Always a tomboy at heart, Amy's been to the
Navy Frogman S<.hooal nd had lots of neatj obs like this
one. She's still in college at Columbia University and
works at the Aquadome during the summer.
DR. JEROME THORPE-Dr. Thorpe is one of those scientific
geniuses who lock themselves up in their labs and
discover things. Unfortunately, sometimes the things they
discover or create aren't too good. Thorpe's claim to fame
is his AH (AMINO-HYDROPHASoErg) anisms that he sup·
posedly manufactured from the AH molecule. There's an
interesting article about him and his experiments in the
Science World magazine

Lab Equipment
COMPUTESTOK-lt's a machine for
troubleshooting your inventions,
machines, or systems. It is connected
to several other machines in the lab.
To use it type ASK COMPUTESTOR
ABOUT (a device).
MICROWAVES ECURITYS CANNf:Rlt
sweepsth e entire grounds of the
ResearchL ab with harmlessm icrowaves.
Any human not wearing a
special identification badge will be
detected if they are on the property.
If intruders are detected, the alarm
will beep loudly.
f:Lf:CTRICAPLA NEL-Inventions
Unlimited generates its own electrical
power.Y ourl ab receivesi ts power
through the electrical panel that's
located in the corridor just EAST of
your lab.
CIRCUIT BKf.:AKf:R- This breaker
controls the power supply to all videophone
equipment in the lab. lt can be
tripped by anyone inside the lab by
simply flipping the switch.
VID[OrttONf:-This communications
device is connected to the Aquadome
and all other Inventions Unlimited
buildings. It's in the middle of your lab
and it works like a telephone. But instead
of just listening to other people,
you can look at them on a screen.
Answer the videophone by turning it
on, then turn the knob to tune it in.
Sub Equipment and
Controls
BRASS S[ARCH LIGHT - This light
comes on automatically when your
sub descends beyond the depths of
sunlight penetration. You can aim it
left or right (port or starboard) to illuminate
objects up to 1000 meters
away.
RfACTOR-The Scimitar is powered by
a midget nuclear reactor, The secret
of the reactor is a special capsule that
must be inserted into the reactor by
the push of a lever that starts the
fusion process

SONARSCOPE-This instrument works
like radar and shows you solid objects
or Sea Cat sonar signals within 2500
meters in any direction and at the
same depth as the Scimitar. Reading
the sonarscopeis like readingt he
nautical chart in this package. As you
read it, remember that your sub
always appears directly in the middle
of the screen. So. as you move, it may
look as if the land is moving instead
of you. If you're on a collision course
with something. a yellow light will
come on. This light will turn red and a
loud buzzer will sound if you're within
one turn of a collision. You should
change course any time a yellow or
red light appears.
SONARPHON[- Underwater communication
relies on sound waves that
are sent and received over this sonar
transceiver. The sonarphone has a
loudspeaker for communicating messages.
It comes on automatically when
signals are incoming.
DEl'TH flNDER-This device uses echo
soundings to determine the depth of
water under the sub. It is usua!ly
turned on when the sub is moving.
During a dive, an orange warning light
comes on and a warning buzzer
sounds when the sub comes within
10 meters of the bottom. The light turns
red and the buzzing becomes shriHer
when the sub comes within 5 meters
of the bottom. You must take immediate
action when this happens.
TEST BUTTON-Many of your inventions
have built-in self-testing devices.
This troubleshooting circuitry is activated
by pushing a test button. The
test results are then displayed on a
readout.
ENGINEC OM.PARTM.t:-NTIt is
located through an access panel in the
bulkhead just below and to the right of
the control panel. If you have to enter
this area, be careful. Too much movement
or wiggling around may pose
serious dangers.

EMERGENCOY XYGENG EAR- This is
a little canister of oxygen that you can
wear around your neck. When you
turn the valve, you can breathe air
through a straw at the top. There is
one canister in the Scimitar.
EXTENSORC LAWS-Thesea re remotecontrolled
devices on the outside of
your sub and are used for hunting and
probing. They can be swiveled and
aimed in any direction. The commands
for moving the claws are TAKE, DROP,
AIM, SHOOT.
Aquadome
Equipment
EMERGENCY SURVIVAL UNIT -This
equipment can save your life should
your sub develop major problems.
It has two parts:
1. an alarm that goes off if your sub
runs !ow on oxygen or the air pressure
starts to drop;
2. a needle that jabs you and wakes
you up if you've passed out or don't
answer the alarm.
AQUATIC DART GUN-Originally
designed as a tranquilizer gun, this dart
gun may be helpful if you encounter a
large creature. Each dart contains a
tranquilizer and can be shot at a fish
to make it drowsy.
The "49er" PROSPECTING
BAZOOKA-This bazooka is useful for
prospecting in undersea rock formations.
Instead of a bullet, it fires a hollow
tube that bores into rock. When
it's removed from the rock. this tube
contains a core sample that can be
raised to the surface with a winch. The
49er is usually fired by a diver from a
shoulder-held position.
St:A CAT - This interesting little craft
is an Inventions Unlimited creation
that crawls along the sea bed like an
underwater bulldozer. The Sea Cat is
segmented into two parts. the main
body that crawls along the bottom.
and a rear power pod that propels it.
Mounted directly above the main body
is a single rock.et pod that can be fired
in any direction ahead of the craft.

Card #1--Front: 
  
IMPORTANT 
READ THIS CARD BEFORE YOU BEGIN 
 
The object of the game is to save the Aquadome from danger. You'll have to navigate your sub, the Scimitar, 
to the Aquadome, and then start solving the mystery with the help of the people that work there. 
 
Getting started 
 
1. To start the game ("boot up"), see the Reference Card that's inside your SEASTALKER package. 
 
2. When you see the prompt (>) on your screen, SEASTALKER is waiting for your command. There are 
three kinds of commands that SEASTALKER understands: 
 
A. Direction commands such as GO WEST 
 
B. Commands that do things such as LOOK AT THE BOOK 
 
C. Commands given to people such as MARV, GIVE ME THE KEY 
 
3. To go places, north, east, south, etc., just type the direction you want to go: N, E, S, W, NE, SE, SW, NW, 
UP, DOWN, IN, OUT. (Notice that you can type the eight compass directions with one or two letters.) Or 
type GO TO (a person, place or thing). 
 
4. To do things, look at things, or explore places, just type whatever it is you want to do. For example: GO 
TO THE AIRLOCK; or OPEN THE HATCH; or EXAMINE THE BOOK are all commands that you might use. 
Once you are familiar with simple commands, you'll want to try some more complex ones. Some examples 
of these can be found in the "Communicating with SEASTALKER" section of your Instruction Manual. 
    
Card #1--Back: 
 
5. To give commands to people, just type their name, then a comma, then the command. For example: BILL, 
GIVE ME THE TOOL, or TIP, TURN ON THE SONARSCOPE. 
 
6. Important! After every command, you should hit the RETURN (or ENTER) key. This will make 
SEASTALKER respond to your command. 
 
7. The special line on your screen is the status line. It tells you three things: the name of the room you are in, 
your score and the number of turns you have taken during the game. 
 
8. You can pick up and carry some items in the game. For example, if you type TAKE THE TOOL, you will 
be carrying the tool. You can type INVENTORY (or I) to find out what you are carrying. 
 
9. If you have any trouble playing, just refer to the Instruction Manual for more detailed instructions and 
sample commands. 
 
10. When you want to stop playing, save your place for later, or start over, see the instructions in the 
"Starting and Stopping" section of your Instruction Manual. 
  
Some clues to help you get started. 
 
1. Answer the videophone 
2. Turn on the microphone 
3. Ask Bly about the problem
