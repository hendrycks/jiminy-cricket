On the Starcross
****************

How do I turn off the alarm bell?
  A. You'll have to go out to the Bridge (walk starboard from the Living
     Quarters).
  B. Have you read the description of the mass detector?
  C. Try pushing the red button. Or, tell the computer to turn it off.

How do I read the output of the mass detector?
  A. This is the space chart that was supplied with your game.
  B. The range is the distance from your ship (center of chart). Theta is
     the angle (in the plane of the chart) from your current course (the
     radiating lines are 15 [degrees] apart). Phi is the angle above or
     below the plane of the chart. (Remember that the chart is a
     two-dimensional representation of three dimensions.) Each phi value can
     be found under the object's designation code.

What is the significance of the ship's registration?
  A. Have you read it?
  B. It has no other significance.

How do I reply to the message from Ceres?
  A. Have you tried COMPUTER, REPLY TO PREVIOUS MESSAGE?
  B. What message from Ceres?

How do I use the ship's controls?
  A. Have you examined them?
  B. Have you tried touching them, turning them on, etc.?
  C. "The computer must be used to set courses, as navigation is fully
     automated." (You can also get status reports from the computer at any
     time.)

How do I know which unidentified mass I should go to?
  A. The mass detector did indicate the correct mass.
  B. Have you looked at the screen on the mass detector?
  C. Each time you start the game, one of the eight unidentified masses is
     randomly chosen as the goal, so it won't be the same every time you
     play.

How do I set a course for a particular object
(for instance, UM08)?
  A. Only the computer can set course.
  B. See your game manual for directions on talking to machines (and Aliens,
     etc.).
  C. Have you tried COMPUTER, SET COURSE FOR UM08?
  D. You must give the computer the range, theta, and phi values from your
     space chart.
  E. For UM08: COMPUTER, R IS 150, THETA IS 210, PHI IS 017 or
         COMPUTER, R IS 150.
         COMPUTER, THETA IS 210.
         COMPUTER, PHI IS 17.
     Of course, the alternate way of speaking to the computer will work just
     as well (TELL COMPUTER "R IS 150..."). When the computer asks for
     confirmation, type COMPUTER, CONFIRM.

Is there a way to get the computer to shut up?
  A. Yes.
  B. Try turning it off.

What do I do with the tape library?
  A. You can take it.
  B. You can turn it on.
  C. You can play tapes.
  D. This is how space travelers alleviate boredom.

How can I leave the ship?
  A. Have you tried opening the door?
  B. Before you open the outer door, you should prepare for a space walk.
  C. Put on the space suit and attach the safety line to the hook in the
     Airlock and to your suit.
  D. You can now go out for a space walk.

How do I get back to the Starcross?
     If you went for a space walk without a safety line, you would be very
     lucky to make it back alive.

What is the safety line for?
     It is dangerous to leave the ship unless you have a safety line
     connecting you to the ship.

How do I land the Starcross on the unidentified mass?
  A. Have you tried telling the computer to land?
  B. It is spinning too rapidly to land on.
  C. Wait for the Artifact to spin under you and inspect it before you
     attempt to land.

How fast is the Artifact spinning?
     Assuming that the "gravity" being simulated at the outer level is 1G,
     it would have to rotate once every 30 seconds or so. This would mean
     that the rotational speed is about 360 kilometers per hour on the outer
     surface.

How do I maneuver the Starcross to the fore end of the unidentified mass?
  A. Unfortunately, you cannot.
  B. +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

     +---------------------------------------------------------------------+


The Red Airlock
***************

What do I do with all the strange protrusions around the airlock?
  A. You could tie your safety line to the hook.
  B. But it is not really necessary as long as you don't jump.
  C. The other protusions are unfathomable.

How do I get into the Artifact?
  A. You won't be able to walk away from the Red Dock area, since without
     metal for your magnetic boots to cling to, you would be flung into
     space. You can open the Red Airlock door.
  B. Have you examined the sculpture on the door?
  C. This is a symbol recognizable by any space-faring species.
  D. Try drawing it as described on a piece of paper.
  E. This is a symbolic representation of your solar system. The bumps are
     an indication of the size and orientation of the sun and planets.
  F. You are being tested, Earthling. What do you think the makers of the
     Artifact want to know?
  G. Your home planet, Earth, is the fourth bump. (The sun is described as
     the first, Mercury would be second, Venus third, Earth fourth.) Try
     pushing the fourth bump.
  H. See the tiny column hint below.
  I. Congratulations, you have passed the test. Take your reward (the black
     crystal rod) and enter.

Is the sculpture significant?
  A. Yes.
  B. See hints B through I above.
  C. If you push the wrong bump and the sculpture flattens out, you'll never
     get into the Artifact.

What is the significance of the tiny column made up of only one hexagon?
  A. It represents an object between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
  B. The size of the bumps is an indication of mass. This column obviously
     represents an object of much smaller mass than a planet.
  C. The tiny column represents your current location -- the Artifact. Try
     pushing it.

Once inside the Artifact, can I take off the space suit?
     Try it.


The Weasel Ship
***************

What do I do with the visor fragment?
  A. Have you tried to look through it?
  B. You probably should take it; you never know what might come in handy.

How do I open the engine room door?
  A. Have you tried the ray gun?
  B. Sorry, this is a dead end.

How are the controls operated?
  A. "The controls look in no way operational."
  B. +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |                                                                     |
     |                                                                     |
     |                                                                     |
     |                                                                     |
     |              >>This space intentionally left blank<<                |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

What is the significance of the skeleton?
  A. The Aliens seem to have left offerings, as if they regard this as a
     holy temple. You had better be careful.
  B. However, you can't be squeamish and rule out any possible actions.
  C. Have you tried touching or moving or taking the skeleton?
  D. Shooting it with the ray gun or touching it a second time will lead to
     unfortunate consequences for you.

How do I hide the violet rod?
  A. Have you tried the metal basket?
  B. Even if you managed to hide it, the Aliens will suspect foul play and
     check the altar. You'll have to find another way to get it past them.
  C. You won't be able to solve this problem until you gain access to the
     Laboratory and learn it secrets. Once you have, read the next hint.
  D. The disks are a perfect escape route for a burglary. Leave one on the
     floor and use the other to transport yourself (and the violet rod) out
     of the Alien ship.
  E. This is the last time you will be able to use the disks, however.


The Computer Room
*****************

How do I fix the computer?
  A. Have you opened the access panel?
  B. You'll have to find the missing card.
  C. It is not a good idea to add or remove circuit boards while the system
     is powered up.

How can the computer be repaired after the electrical fire?
  A. You'll have to have it serviced by the manufacturer.
  B. In other words, it can't be fixed. Don't put cards into the racks while
     the power is on.

Where is the missing card?
  A. If you thoroughly explore the Artifact, you should find it.
  B. Advanced technology may make it different from circuit boards you are
     accustomed to.
  C. The metal and ceramic square in the Repair Room will work.

What does the enunciator panel signify?
  A. Try drawing the diagrams as described.
  B. The three banks of lights on the left each have four colored lights. Do
     the colors remind you of anything?
  C. The colors are associated with the four main corridors.
  D. "The first [bank of lights] is labeled with a symbol of the emission of
     rays..." What do the red and yellow halls have in common?
  E. The "emission of rays" is a symbol for light. The red hallway lights
     are fading. The yellow hallway is either dark or under emergency
     lighting. (If it's dark, you could tell that it is yellow by process of
     elimination -- as you approached the Artifact you saw blue, _yellow_,
     green, and red docking ports.)
  F. The other two banks of lights on the left indicate problems with the
     yellow docking port and the yellow airlock.
  G. The symbol for the sixth light on the right represents solid, liquid,
     gas (the light is associated with the last of these).
  H. The sixth light indicates a progressively worsening problem with the
     ship's atmosphere.


All the Aliens
**************

How do I kill all the Weasels?
  A. The only weapon effective against them is the ray gun.
  B. But you will not be able to kill them all, and the others will not
     appreciate your actions.
  C. The only way to kill them all is to allow the ship's condition to
     deteriorate to the point where everyone dies. This, unfortunately, will
     include you.

How can I get past the palisades?
  A. They cannot be climbed.
  B. The ray gun is not powerful enough to break through, but will do enough
     damage to annoy the Aliens.
  C. There is nothing at your disposal that is more powerful than the ray
     gun. You cannot get past the palisades.

How do I pass the hostile Weasels?
     You shouldn't have annoyed them. They won't let you pass.

How do I get the brown crystal rod from the Alien Chief?
  A. You will not be able to overpower him in a fight.
  B. The ray gun leaves nothing useful.
  C. Have you ever come upon him while wearing or carrying your space suit?
  D. He is very interested in the space suit. Try giving it to him.
  E. His gestures are his way of offering a gift in return.
  F. Point (or gesture) at his brown rod.

What does the Alien Chief's gesturing mean?
     It is common in many cultures for new acquaintances to exchange gifts.

What can the Weasel slave do for me?
  A. If you must ask, I'm afraid I can't help you.
  B. What Weasel slave?

What is the significance of the unicorn meat?
  A. Could it be edible?
  B. Raw meat is not very sanitary (or appetizing). Wouldn't it be better to
     cook it? (The ray gun is great for this sort of thing.)
  C. Medium rare requires 30 seconds at the second setting. You can vary the
     time if you prefer it rarer or more well-done. (Add 10 seconds to
     defrost if this is from the freezer compartment.)
  D. By the way, where did you come across unicorn meat?
  E. Keep in mind the warning in the introduction: Do not use the presence
     or absence of a question on a certain topic as an indication of what is
     important, and don't assume that long answers indicate important
     questions.

How do I find my way through the Warren?
  A. You will never find the way unaided.
  B. Have you considered a native guide?
  C. Try following the Alien Chief once you have the brown rod in your
     possession.

What should I do with the ladder?
     Try climbing down.

What is a grue?
     Try typing WHAT IS A GRUE?

Can I reach the body in the debris?
  A. Yes, but you can't rely solely on your magnetic boots (no pun
     intended).
  B. Try using your safety line. Tie it to the hook and to your suit.

How do I get the grues' rod?
  A. You might try to capture a grue.
  B. Don't go on until you have been to the Laboratory.
  C. Don't go on until you have figured out what the disks are.
  D. A great way to catch a grue would be to leave a disk in a dark room and
     wait (somewhere else) for one to step on it.
  E. Unfortunately, there are no longer any dark rooms on the ship.
  F. Also, the grues don't have a rod.

What do I do about the Spider?
  A. He certainly _seems_ friendly.
  B. What is his problem?
  C. He is extremely bored.
  D. Can you help him?
  E. Haven't you heard enough about the history of Brazil in the 2030's?
  F. Why not give him your tape player?

How do I escape the web?
     If you had smeared lubricant on your space suit, you wouldn't have
     gotten stuck.

Where do I find the lubricant?
  A. How did you get stuck in the web?
  B. There is no lubricant.
  C. InvisiClues veterans will recognize this as a "lesson" question. If
     every question in this book were pertinent to the game, the questions
     themselves would give far too much away. Questions such as this should
     convince you to ignore those that are not of immediate use.

How do I answer Gurthark's questions?
     There is unfortunately no way for you to answer most of them.

How do I get Gurthark to follow me?
  A. Have you tried GURTHARK, FOLLOW ME?
  B. He won't.

How do I get the red rod from the Rat-ants?
  A. They don't seem to be open to negotiation. More direct methods will be
     necessary.
  B. The ray gun is too effective on the nest, and not effective enough
     against individual groups of Rat-ants (there are just too many).
  C. Have you examined the Rat-ants and the nest?
  D. The nest is described as "jerry-built" and "precariously stuck
     together."
  E. Although kicking it is not effective, you can destroy it by throwing
     something fairly heavy at it. While the Rat-ants are rebuilding, you
     have a chance to take the rod.

How did the Rat-ants get to the Artifact?
  A. Their crude intelligence is an indication that they did not arrive here
     on their own.
  B. Presumably they were among the original inhabitants of the zoo.


The Laboratory
**************

What is the silvery globe in the Laboratory?
     This is a technology so far beyond current human experience that it is
     impossible to explain. Ask again when you fully understand the details
     of the Matter Intransitivity Principle of the Dornbrookian Unified
     Field Theory.

What do I do with the silvery globe?
  A. It's a force field.
  B. You can't push it or climb on it.
  C. Have you tried changing the dial setting?

Can I take the blue rod?
  A. You can't take it directly, but there are ways to get it.
  B. There is no way to block the beam or turn it off.
  C. The preferred solution starts at D. An alternate solution starts at I.
  D. Have you ever tried putting anything on the sphere and then changing
     the dial setting?
  E. You will have to learn how to use the red and blue disks before going
     on.
  F. You could use the disks to enter the sphere ("but it would be wrong").
     Put one disk under the sphere and then set the dial to 4. Step on the
     other disk.
  G. Can you think of a way to get the disk to activate while it is in the
     sphere?
  H. Put a disk under the sphere. Put something on the sphere. Set the dial
     to 4. The object placed on the globe will fall onto the disk inside,
     causing it to activate. Luckily, the blue rod is within range of the
     disk.
  I. Do you know of anything that might be able to deal with these
     technologically-advanced forces?
  J. You have probably already used something powerful and similarly
     advanced.
  K. You can use the ray gun to eliminate the sphere momentarily and get the
     blue rod. However, you will find that you don't have a shot to spare
     for this purpose.

How do I turn off the projector?
  A. You can't turn it off.
  B. You can't harm it.
  C. Even the ray gun is useless against it.

What causes the loud clicking sound?
     It is probably due to air rushing in to fill the void.

What is done with the red and blue disks?
  A. Although they may not appear to be much, they are probably the most
     sophisticated machines on the Artifact.
  B. The manhole-cover size is not a coincidence.
  C. Try putting both on the floor and stepping on one.
  D. They have a built-in safety feature which allows them to transport
     things only when both are on floors.

How can the lights be dimmed?
     They can't.


The Inner Region
****************

Is there any significance to the bands of metal, grass, and forest?
     Either the ship was designed like this (who knows what an alien race
     may regard as pleasant landscaping?), or maybe some major acceleration
     in the past caused most of the soil to shift to the aft end of the
     Artifact.

How do I catch a unicorn?
     "Only one of royal blood..." (just joking). You can't do anything to
     the unicorns other than incinerate them.

What is the significance of the unicorn hunt?
  A. The Weasel Aliens have to eat something other than vegetables to get a
     balanced diet.
  B. You can disrupt the hunt, but there is nothing important going on.

What is the machine to the left in the Repair Room for?
  A. You could experiment by putting the appropriate object in the yellow
     slot.
  B. The "symbol depicting the emission of rays" indicates that this machine
     has something to do with the lights.
  C. Put the yellow crystal rod in the slot. The emergency lighting in the
     yellow hallway will now come on.

What is the purpose of the machine on the right in the Repair Room?
  A. Try drawing the symbols as described.
  B. It has some similarities to the computer enunciator panel.
  C. The solid block, fluid level, and parallel wavy lines symbolize solid,
     liquid, and gas, respectively.
  D. The diagrams of dots are associated with the gas symbol. For further
     details, see the question about the dots.

What do the groups of dots mean?
  A. These are symbols that any species capable of space flight should be
     able to decipher.
  B. They are not mathematical symbols. Try writing them as described on a
     piece of paper.
  C. Try experimenting. Put the proper item into the first, second, or third
     red slot and see what happens. (It will take a while to notice the
     effect.)
  D. The proper item to put in the slots is the red crystal rod.
  E. Have you ever studied chemistry?
  F. The six dots with four evenly-spaced dots around them symbolize methane
     (carbon of atomic number six surrounded by four hydrogens of atomic
     number one). The seven dots with three equally-spaced dots around them
     symbolize ammonia (nitrogen of atomic number seven with three
     hydrogens). The two groups of eight dots closely associated represent
     the oxygen molecule (two oxygen atoms of atomic number eight). These
     gases make up three possible planetary atmospheres.
  G. In case you don't know, you want oxygen (that's the second red slot).

How do I get up to the Drive Bubble?
  A. Presumably you have already climbed to the top of the tree.
  B. Jump.

How is the Drive Bubble hatch opened?
  A. "Beside the hatch is a silver slot."
  B. Try using the appropriate "key" (crystal rod).
  C. Put the silver rod in the silver slot.

How do I get back down from the Drive Bubble hatch?
  A. Jumping is not a good idea. (It is a death worth trying, though.)
  B. Try DOWN.

Why do things fall in curves?
     Look up the "Coriolis Force" in a physics textbook.

How can I get up to the bubble at the fore end?
  A. You cannot scale the wall at the fore end.
  B. A more appropriate question is, "How do I get _over_ to the bubble at
     the fore end?"
  C. There is no "gravity" along the axis of rotation of the cylinder.
  D. Try jumping from the center of the aft end (on Drive Bubble).
  E. "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction."
  F. Throwing objects won't be enough to overcome 5 km of air resistance.
     You will need to use the ray gun.
  G. You must shoot it at the Drive Bubble to ensure that you are not pushed
     in the wrong direction or forced off-axis.
  H. You will need all three ray gun shots to reach your destination.


The Bubbles
***********

How can I activate the Drive Bubble controls, and what can I do with them?
  A. Put the white rod in the white slot.
  B. "You can't do anything with them."
  C. You must activate the drive if you wish to set a new course. All
     further control is from the Control Bubble.

Is there any reason to use the black rod?
  A. No.
  B. +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |                                                                     |
     |                                                                     |
     |                                                                     |
     |                                                                     |
     |              >>This space intentionally left blank<<                |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

How do I open the Control Bubble hatch?
  A. "A small slot surrounded by gold crystal is next to the hatch."
  B. Put the gold rod in the gold slot.

Why is the clear crystal slot rejecting my clear crystal rod?
  A. The control room functions are very dependent on the main computer.
  B. Unless the computer is in a working state and turned on, you cannot
     activate the controls.

What is done with the five slots?
     As usual, put the appropriate colored rods in the slots.

What is going on with the spots, squares, and screen?
  A. These are the main controls. You should be able to figure them out by
     fiddling with them and seeing what happens.
  B. Pushing the small pink square causes the view screen to zoom in to
     closer and closer regions around the Artifact. Pushing the large pink
     square causes the view screen to zoom out to longer and longer range.
  C. You are interested in the inner solar system.
  D. Pushing the brown spot selects the destination. Pushing the violet spot
     selects the course you will take. Pushing the green spot selects the
     speed. You will not be able to set the speed if you haven't activated
     the drive controls (in the Drive Bubble). Pushing the blue spot
     executes the course correction burn you have selected.
  E. You may choose a number of different destinations and courses, but only
     two combinations are correct: the courses ending in an ellipse or a
     circle around Earth. (Try the others for fun.)

Why do the spots flash?
     If you press a spot out of sequence, it will flash.

How do I get back down from the Control Bubble?
  A. You can get down in the usual messy way by jumping from the control
     hatch.
  B. Just make sure you have everything you need to gain control of the ship
     and set a new course.


General Questions
*****************

Why is the Artifact suddenly shutting down?
     Because the air is becoming unbreathable. (Try removing your space suit
