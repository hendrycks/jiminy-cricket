   Schmidt traced back the path of the alien ship; the path points out of the
galaxy without nearing any star system. Further, extending the path leads
straight to one of our smaller neighboring galaxies. Schmidt concludes that
the ship and the pyramid are probably well over one billion years old!|
   Next, Schmidt studied the wall markings in the alien ship. A series of
identical dots, they defied every computerized model of linguistic
decipherment! Then, in an inspiration, Schmidt studied the dots for nonvisual
properties. His diary vaguely refers to a breakthrough, saying, \"I guess my
pal, the mayor, will get to show off his linguistic training.\"|
   Finally, Schmidt began concentrating his studies on the pyramid itself.
He was able to discover very little, blaming this primarily on the unexplained
failures of several crucial pieces of lab machinery.")

evil emanations right back into itself. A reverberating whine, like an

louder, the pyramid and its pedestal begin vibrating, and the sharp smell of
ozone assaults you.|
   The noise and the smell and the vibration overwhelm you. As your knees
buckle and you drop to the deck, the pyramid explodes in a burst of intense

a mechanized voice on the P.A. system, getting slower and deeper like a stereo
disc that has lost its power: \"Launch aborted -- launch -- abort --\"|

sound tells you that the space station's systems and machinery are returning

lifeless. One of his compartments falls open, and Floyd's favorite paddleball
set drops to the deck.|

robot that stirred such brotherly feelings in Floyd. Toddling over to you on
unsteady legs, he looks uncomprehendingly at Floyd's remains, but picks up the
