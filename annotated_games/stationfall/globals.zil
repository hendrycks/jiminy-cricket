"The quiet, dusty corridors stir disturbing memories. You're back on Resida,
the deserted, plague-stricken world where you met Floyd. A hot flush creeps
over you, indicating that the virulent disease that conquered this planet is
beginnning its insidious work on you[ID: globals:960]"

"You are strolling across Deck Four of the Duffy, when suddenly you remember
that you were supposed to have Handwriting Legibility Evaluation Forms -- all
nine parts, for every member of the crew -- on Captain Fussbottom's desk by
7800. It's 7790, and those forms are stored on the other side of the ship.
You try to run, but the floor is covered with glue. You can hear the Captain
calling your name, louder and louder, as you struggle to move your legs[ID: globals:967]"

"You gulp down the last of your Ramosian Fire Nectar and ask the andro-waiter
for another pitcher. This pub makes the finest Nectar on all of Ramos Two, and
you and your shipmates are having a pretty rowdy time. Through the windows of
the pub you can see a mighty, ancient castle, shining in the light of the three
Ramosian moons. The Fire Nectar spreads through your blood and you begin to
feel drowsy"

;"Strangely, you wake back home on Gallium; even more strangely, you are only
eight years old again. You are playing with your pet sponge-cat, Swanzo, by the
the pond in your backyard. Mom is hanging orange towels on the clothesline.
Suddenly the school bully leaps from behind a bush and pushes your head under
the water. You try to scream, but cannot. You feel your life draining away"

"You wake up in a huge stadium, watching an important ceremony. It's a Stellar
Patrol promotion ceremony on Tremain! Suddenly your own name echoes over the
P.A. system -- and down below you see YOURSELF walking up the steps to the stage!
The presiding admiral describes your heroism on Resida, mentioning that you
were awarded the key to the planet, and then asks the ceremonial question,
\"Do you accept promotion to Lieutenant First Class?\" You try to yell \"No!\"
from the stands, but the words are lost in the vastness of the stadium"

"You find yourself in a spacepod outside the docking bays of a large space
station. All the doors are closed. You snap on the radio, and discover that
Floyd is in charge within the station. \"Open the pod bay doors, Floyd,\" you
tell him but he replies, \"I'm sorry, I can't do that,\" and begins laughing
and your air is beginning to run out[ID: globals:994]"

"At last, the Duffy is approaching station Delta Upsilon Upsilon Phi -- your
first rec leave in almost six months. It's even worth the six solid days of
paperwork necessary for a standard half-day leave. Stationfall is millichrons
away, but suddenly you realize that you're all alone on the Duffy! Frantic,
you dash to the deserted bridge, but it's too late to stop the out-of-control
Duffy from ramming the massive space station! The hull of the station rushes
toward you[ID: globals:1002]">>
