[The front cover shows a space-suited member of the Stellar Patrol stepping
through a triangular window cut into the box. A backdrop of outer space can be
seen through the window, while the Space Station you are about to visit floats
above and to the right of the Stellar Patrol recruit. The recruit is humanoid,
but all other features are hidden by the helmet's visor, jumpsuit, backpack,
gloves and sneaker-like boots. The recruit carries a clipboard in hand, but
some of the pages held by the clipboard are starting to slip away, floating
around him/her.]



---------

Assigned to each STATIONFALL package: your STATIONFALL disk, a set of
blueprints for a Gamma-Delta-Gamma Class deep space station; three highly
bureaucratic forms; and your Stellar Patrol patch.

[The game components are shown sitting on a stack of square cardboard boxes,
each one stamped with "Request for Stellar Patrol Issue Regulation Black Form
Binders Request Form Forms". A clipboard with an Inventory sheet rests near
them. The patch shown in the picture is different than what actually came in
the package. Instead of a round fabric patch, patch that's shown appears to be
more like a stick-on decal, cut to follow the shape of the "triangle and halo"
design of the Stellar Patrol logo.]


What a trotting krip! Since your incredible heroics in "Planetfall", where you
risked life and limb to save the planet Resida, things have hardly changed at
all. Sure, you were promoted to Lieutenant First Class, but this only meant
that your dull life of cleaning grotch cages was replaced by an equally dull
life of paperwork. Now you've got another assignment tailor-made for a
grotchbrain: pilot a spacetruck to a nearby station to pick up a load of
trivial forms. Trot and double trot!

But all is not lost. By a happy twist of fate, your companion for the journey
is your old pal Floyd! That's right, it's the same mischievous little robot,
crayons and paddleball at the ready, who was your helpful buddy in "Planetfall".

Getting to the space station is easy. But once there, you find it strangely
deserted. Even the seedy space village surrounding the station is missing its
ragtag tenants. A spooky alien ship carrying only an empty pedestal rests in a
docking bay. An ostrich and an Arcturian balloon creature are found, abandoned
but in perfect health. The commander's log describes the mysterious breakdown
of machinery, demonstrated by a roving hull-welder who seems bent on your
destruction. And finally even Floyd begins acting oddly...

Steve Meretzky, whose interactive fiction successes include The "Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy" (TM) and "Leather Goddesses of Phobos" (TM), won a Best
Computer Software Designer award for "Planetfall". Infocom fans, consistently
rating "Planetfall" among their favorite computer games, have been begging for
a sequel. Even if you've never played "Planetfall", you will enjoy Stationfall:
the puzzles will challenge your intellect, the humor will keep you laughing,
and Floyd will win your heart.

The Stellar Patrol patch:

[This is a round fabric patch, about 2 inches in diameter, with a border of
gold thread. The logo of the Stellar Patrol printed on it: "Boldly Going Where
Angels Fear to Tread" printed on a red triangle with a picture of a few planets
in the center. The triangle shows a "halo" in front and behind it, which is
actually the orbital path of a spaceship. Just below the triangle is your rank:
Lieutenant First Class.]

SECTION I: ABOUT STATIONFALL

Preface to the Story

After the fall of the Second Galactic Union in 1716 GY, a ten-thousand-year
dark age settled upon the galaxy. Interstellar travel was non-existent, and
many star systems descended into a near-barbaric state, burning fossil fuels
for energy and growing food directly from exposed topsoil.

In 11,203 GY, a treaty between the growing empires of Tremain and Gallium
formed the Third Galactic Union. A pseudo-military branch of the Union
government on Tremain was created. Called the Stellar Patrol, its ships began
exploring the galaxy, searching for the human civilizations that are the
remnants of the Second Union.

You are a native of Gallium, one of the most politically powerful but
culturally barren worlds of the Union. Your great-great-grandfather was a
founding officer of the Stellar Patrol, and for five generations, your family
has served in the Patrol. It was always taken for granted that you would sign
up as soon as you came of age.

Once you joined the Patrol, you discovered that the exciting career promised in
all the Patrol recruitment brochures was nonsense. Your life was drudgery and
demerits. The only time you got to see an exotic planet was right after a big
parade, when they needed a detail to sweep up all the confetti.

Then came your big moment: shipwrecked on a seemingly deserted world, you met
an exuberant robotic companion named Floyd. Together, the two of you discovered
the secret of that mysterious planet, Resida, and saved it from near
destruction. The story of that heroic deed was told in "Planetfall".

As a result of your heroics, you were offered, and quickly accepted, a juicy
promotion. Goodbye Ensign Seventh Class -- now you were a Lieutenant First
Class! No more scrubwork! No more bathroom details! No more cleaning of the
grotch cages! Finally, your life in the Stellar Patrol would be as exciting as
those brochures had promised!

Oh, how naive you'd been. Your daily routine simply replaced tedious scrubwork
with tedious paperwork. Since your planetfall on Resida, five long years have
dragged by, without a single solitary event worthy of note. Why, just look at
today's "thrilling" assignment: scooting over to Space Station Gamma Delta
Gamma 777-G 59/59 Sector Alpha-Mu-79 to pick up a supply of Request for Stellar
Patrol Issue Regulation Black Form Binders Request Form Forms...

Sample Transcript and Map

This transcript is not from Stationfall, but will give you a good general idea
of how Infocom's interactive fiction works. It contains some simple puzzles and
their solutions. The player's commands appear in capital letters after each
prompt (>). The map represents the terrain in the sample transcript as you
might have drawn it.

[Sample map not included.]

>WAIT
Time passes...

The scooter glides into the station's docking port. The retro-thrusters bring
the scooter to a halt. As the docking port fills with air the scooter's hatch
opens.

>LOOK
Scooter, in the pilot's couch

You are in the cramped one-man space scooter. Through the viewport, you see the
docking port of Space Station BG-12. The scooter's hatch is open.You can see a
toolbox here.

>OPEN THE TOOLBOX
You can't reach it from the pilot's couch.

>STAND UP
You are standing again.

>OPEN THE TOOLBOX
It's locked.

>LEAVE THE SCOOTER
Docking Port
This is the huge docking port of the space station. Only one ship is here at
the moment, a one-man scooter, so the docking port seems unusually empty. A
tube leads down toward the heart of the station.

>DOWN
Main Hallway, Sector M
This is the station's main corridor, which continues to port and starboard. A
tube leads up toward the docking port.

>STARBOARD
Main Hallway, Sector N
This is the station's main corridor, which continues to port and starboard. A
room lies to fore, and a tube leads down to the next level of the station.
Lying at the base of the wall is a key.

>TAKE THE KEY
Taken.

>EXAMINE IT
The key looks like one of those new all-purpose keys that molds itself to any
lock. A typical example of Garfoogian ingenuity.

>FORE
Sick Bay
Like the rest of the station, the medical facility is deserted. This is odd,
for regulations require that the sick bay be staffed around the clock, ten
chrons a day! The only exit is aft.
At the far end of the room, inside a steel cage, is a Thoosian Fussbudget,
apparently asleep.

>WAKE THE FUSSBUDGET
It jumps to its feet, all twelve of them. "Hey, what's going on? Who are you?
Lemme outta here!"

>OPEN THE CAGE
The cage is locked.
"Open the cage!" begs the Fussbudget, clawing at the bars. "I'm claustrophobic!
I'll starve to death! I wanna go jogging!"

>UNLOCK THE CAGE WITH THE KEY
This seems to be one of those new sophisticated all-purpose-key-proof locks.
"Break the bars! Get an acetylene torch! Find a teleporter! I've got an
appointment with my lawyer in five minutes! I'm allergic to cages!" The
Fussbudget begins sneezing wildly.

>AFT.PORT.UP.ENTER THE SCOOTER.UNLOCK THE TOOLBOX WITH THE KEY

Docking Port
You are beginning to get hungry.

Scooter
You can see a toolbox here.

The toolbox is now unlocked.

>OPEN THE TOOLBOX
Opening the toolbox reveals an identity bracelet, a hacksaw, and a tube of
nutrient paste.

>TAKE ALL FROM THE TOLBOX
[I don't know the word "tolbox."]

>OOPS TOOLBOX
identity bracelet: Taken.
hacksaw: Taken.
tube of nutrient paste: You're carrying too much weight already.

>INVENTORY
You are carrying a hacksaw, an identity bracelet, a key, and a box of
radioactive isotopes. You are wearing a Patrol uniform.

>DROP ALL BUT THE HACKSAW AND THE BRACELET THEN TAKE THE TUBE
key: Dropped.
box of radioactive isotopes: Dropped.
Patrol uniform: You'll have to remove it first.
Taken.
You are now quite hungry.

>EAT THE PASTE
Mmmm...one of your favorites...anchovies and peanut butter. You empty the
entire tube, and your hunger dissipates.

>OUT.DOWN.STARBOARD.FORE

"It's about time you got back. You think it's fun being locked in a cage?
What if there was a fire?"

>CUT THE BARS WITH THE HACKSAW
You cut through one of the bars. The Fussbudget sticks its head through the
gap. "Come one, cut some more! I'm almost out...do you think these edges where
you cut the bars are sharp?"

>AGAIN
You cut a second bar. The Fussbudget squeezes through and leaps to the floor.
"Thanks, bud. By the way, I'm a Fussbudget." It hops across the room and pokes
four or five eye stalks cautiously through the doorway. "Where is everyone?
Hey, that looks like a tube of nutrient paste you've got there."

>GIVE THE TUBE TO THE FUSSBUDGET
The Fussbudget grabs the tube, wildly squeezes it with all six hands, and then
throws it to the deck. "Empty! If I don't eat something soon I'll get sick."

>AFT
Main Hallway, Sector N
The Fussbudget gangles after you.

>PORT
Main Hallway, Sector M
The Fussbudget gangles after you.

>PORT

About the Author

Steve Meretzky (1957-   ) was born and raised in Yonkers, NY, where his early
hobbies included rooting for the New York Mets and against Richard Nixon.

Historians of interactive fiction point to Meretzky's first job, packing nuts
and bolts for his father's hardware business, as the formative moment of his
writing career. Most others think that there's absolutely no connection, and
that all historians of interactive fiction are fruitcakes.

Meretzky arrived at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in September of
1975 to pursue a career in architecture. MIT's Department of Architecture
convinced Meretzky that he should pursue a career in Construction Management.
Following his unexpected graduation, several construction firms convinced
Meretzky that he should pursue a career as a game tester for Infocom. Finally,
by 1982, Marc Blank had convinced Meretzky that he should pursue a career as an
author of interactive fiction ("implementor" in Infocom lingo).

While at Infocom, a heart-warming interoffice romance blossomed between Steve
and the Sales Department's Elizabeth Rock. Married since September of 1985,
Steve and Betty have no children, but they do have a garage door opener that
they're very proud of.

Other works of interactive fiction by Steve Meretzky:
Planetfall (1983)
Sorcerer (1984)
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1984) (with Douglas Adams)
A Mind Forever Voyaging (1985)
Leather Goddesses of Phobos (1986)

SECTION II: ABOUT INFOCOM'S INTERACTIVE FICTION


An Overview: What is interactive fiction?

Interactive fiction is a story in which you are the main character. Each
interactive story, such as Stationfall, presents you with a series of
locations, items, characters, and events. You can affect the direction of the
story by moving from place to place, using the objects you find, and
interacting with the other characters.

An important element of interactive fiction is puzzle-solving. Think of a
locked door or a ferocious beast not as a permanent obstacle, but merely as a
puzzle to be tackled. (Find the key that unlocks the door, or figure out what
tune will charm and tame that beast.)

In Stationfall, time passes only in response to your input. Nothing happens
until you type a sentence and press the RETURN (or ENTER) key, so you can plan
your turns as slowly and carefully as you want.

In the story, time is kept in millichrons, the galactic standard. A thousand
millichrons make up on chron, and ten chrons make up one day. In addition to
keeping track of the time, Stationfall measures your progress by giving you a
score. You'll get points for solving puzzles and for reaching certain new
locations. A perfect score of 80 is your goal; making sure you have fun getting
there is ours.

Page 7

Starting and Stopping

Starting the story: To load Stationfall, follow the instructions on the
Reference Card in your package.

On your screen, you will see a description of the opening location of the
story, Deck Five, followed by the prompt (>), indicating that Stationfall is
waiting for your first input.

Here are a few inputs for you to try at the first several prompts. After typing
each input, don't forget to hit the RETURN (or ENTER) key.

>INVENTORY
>EXAMINE THE PATROL UNIFORM
>WALK STARBOARD
>DROP THE CHRONOMETER

You should now have a feel for interacting with the story. You decide what to
do next.


Saving and restoring: It will probably take you several days to complete
Stationfall. Using the SAVE feature, you can continue the story at a later time
without having to start over from the beginning, just as you can place a
bookmark in a book you are reading. Even if you aren't about to stop playing,
it's useful to SAVE before (or after) trying something dangerous or tricky.
That way, even if you get lost or "killed" in the story, you can return to your
saved position.

To save your place, type SAVE at the prompt (>), and then press RETURN (or
ENTER). Then follow the instructions for saving and restoring on your Reference
Card. Some computers require a blank SAVE disk, initialized and formatted.
Using a disk with data on it (other than Stationfall saves) may result in the
loss of that data, depending on your computer. You can save your position as
often as you like by using additional blank disks.

Any time you want to return to a saved position, just typed RESTORE at the
prompt (>), and hit RETURN (or ENTER). Then follow the instructions on your
Reference Card. You can then continue the story from your SAVE. You can type
LOOK for a description of where you are.


Quitting and restarting: If you want to start over from the beginning, type
RESTART and press the RETURN (or ENTER) key. (This is usually faster than
re-booting.) Stationfall will ask you to confirm this command.

If you want to stop entirely, type QUIT and press RETURN (or ENTER). Once
again, Stationfall will ask to make sure this is really what you want to do.

Remember, when you RESTART or QUIT, you must first SAVE if you ever want to
return easily to your current point in the story.



---------

Page 8

Communicating with Infocom's Interactive Fiction

In Stationfall, you type your commands in plain English each time you see the
prompt (>). Most of the sentences that Stationfall will understand are
imperative sentences. See the examples below.

When you have finished typing your input, press the RETURN (or ENTER) key.
Stationfall will then respond, telling you whether your request is possible at
this point in the story, and what happened as a result.

Stationfall recognizes your words by their first six letters, and all
subsequent letters are ignored. For example, Stationfall would not be able to
distinguish among SPACEShip, SPACEStorm, and SPACESickness.

To move around, just type the direction you want to go. Directions can be
abbreviated: NORTH to N, SOUTH to S, EAST to E, WEST to W, NORTHEAST to NE,
NORTHWEST to NW, SOUTHEAST to SE, SOUTHWEST to SW, UP to U, and DOWN to D. IN
and OUT will also work in certain places.

Stationfall understands many different kinds of sentences. Here are examples,
using objects and characters that don't actually appear in Stationfall:

>WALK TO THE NORTH
>WEST
>NE
>DOWN
>TAKE THE METEORITE
>OPEN THE HATCH
>READ THROUGH THE MANUAL
>LIE DOWN ON THE ACCELERATION COUCH
>EXAMINE THE SHINY LASER RIFLE
>PUT THE POWER PACK IN THE RIFLE
>SHOW MY ANTENNAE TO THE ALIEN AMBASSADOR
>SHOOT THE MENACING ALIEN WITH THE SHINY LASER RIFLE
>ASK THE SENTIENT CRAB ABOUT THE ELECTRON MICROSCOPE

You can use multiple objects with certain verbs if you separate them by the
word AND or by a comma. Some examples:

>TAKE THE MEGAFUSE AND THE TANGERINE
>DROP THE BOTTLE OF ARGON, THE SPOON, AND THE LEMMING FOOD
>PUT THE MATTER AND THE ANTI-MATTER IN THE BOX

You can include several commands on one line if you separate them by the word
THEN or by a period. Each command will be handled in order, as though you had
typed them individually at separate prompts. For example, you could type all of
the following at once, before pressing the RETURN (or ENTER) key:

>PUSH THE BUTTON. ENTER THE SPACE SCOOTER THEN SHUT THE HATCH

If Stationfall doesn't understand one of the sentences on your input line, or
if an unusual event occurs, it will ignore the rest of your input line.

The words IT and ALL can be very useful. For example:

>LOOK AT THE OXYGEN TANK. TAKE IT. PUT IT ON.
>TURN ON THE HYPERSPATIAL COMPUTER. PROGRAM IT. TURN IT OFF.
>PICK UP THE ENERGY TABLET. SMELL IT. SWALLOW IT.
>TAKE ALL
>TAKE ALL THE TOOLS
>DROP ALL THE TOOLS EXCEPT THE WRENCH AND THE PHOTON SPANNER
>TAKE ALL FROM THE CARTON
>PUT ALL IN THE POCKET OF THE JUMPSUIT
>GIVE ALL BUT THE BATTERY TO THE BROKEN CYBORG

The word ALL refers to every visible object except those inside something else.
If there were an apple on the ground and an orange inside a cabinet, TAKE ALL
would take the apple but not the orange.

There are only three kinds of questions that Stationfall understands: WHO IS
(someone), WHERE IS (something), and WHAT IS (something). Here are some examples
you can try in Stationfall:

>WHO IS PLATO?
>WHAT IS A GRUE?
>WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

When you meet intelligent creatures in Stationfall, you can talk to them by
typing their name, then a comma, then whatever you want to say to them. Here
are some examples:

>ZEKE, HELLO
>CAPTAIN MEASEL, TELL ME ABOUT THE ASTEROID
>UNCLE OTTO, GIVE ME YOUR WALLET
>BOY, RUN HOME THEN CALL THE POLICE
>GALACTIC OVERLORD, PICK UP THAT PLANETOID. EAT IT

Notice that in the last two examples, you are giving the character more than
one command on the same input line. But remember, many creatures in the story
don't care for idle chatter.

You can use quotes to answer a question, type something on a keyboard, or say
something "out loud." Examples:

>SAY "HELLO"
>ANSWER "YES"
>TYPE "520"

Stationfall tries to guess your intention when you give incomplete information.
When it does so, it will tell you. For example:

>UNLOCK THE CONTROL PANEL
[with the key]
The panel is now unlocked.

or

>SHOOT THE SEVEN-HEADED PURPLE ALIEN
[with the seven-headed purple alien gun]
A bolt of energy vaporizes one of the alien's heads. Unfortunately, it
continues to advance, and there isn't a six-headed purple alien gun in sight.
If your command is ambiguous, Stationfall will ask you to clarify. You can
answer these questions simply by supplying the missing information at the very
next prompt. For example:

>SHOW THE HOLOGRAM
Whom do you want to show the hologram to?

>THE BUG-EYED MONSTER
The monster takes one look at the hologram of the slime pits of its homeworld,
has an acute attack of homesickness, and runs off in search of a travel agent.

or

>GIVE THE MELON TO THE ALIEN
Which melon do you mean, the honeydew melon or the moldy Venusian melon?

>MOLDY
The alien, grateful for such a delicious homeworld delicacy, gives you its time
travel belt.

Special Commands

Below are explanations for a number of useful one-word commands. In many cases,
these will not count as a turn. Type the command after the prompt (>) and press
the RETURN (or ENTER) key.

AGAIN -- This will repeat your previous input. For instance, typing SHOOT THE
LASER AT THE RADIUM-POWERED ROBOT then typing AGAIN would be like trying to kill
the robot twice in a row. You can abbreviate AGAIN to G.

BRIEF -- This command tells Stationfall to fully describe a location only the
first time you enter it. On subsequent visits, Stationfall will tell you only
the name of the location and any objects present. Stationfall will begin in
BRIEF mode, and remain in BRIEF mode unless you use the VERBOSE or SUPERBRIEF
commands. SUPERBRIEF tells Stationfall to display only the name of a place you
have entered, even if you have never been there before. In this mode,
Stationfall will not even mention which objects are present. Of course, you can
always get a full description of your location and the items there by typing
LOOK. In SUPERBRIEF mode, the blank line between turns will be eliminated. This
mode is meant for players who are already familiar with the geography. The
VERBOSE command tells Stationfall that you want a complete description of each
location, and the objects in it, every time you enter a location, even if
you've been there before.

DIAGNOSE -- Stationfall will give you a report of your physical condition.

FOOTNOTE -- Occasionally, the text in Stationfall will mention the existence of
a footnote. To read the footnote, simply type FOOTNOTE followed by the
appropriate footnote number (for example, FOOTNOTE 7). This will not count as a
turn.

INVENTORY -- Stationfall will list what you are carrying and wearing. You can
abbreviate INVENTORY to I.

LOOK -- This will give you a full description of your location. You can
abbreviate LOOK to L.

OOPS -- If you mistype a word, such that Stationfall doesn't understand it, you
can correct yourself at the next prompt by typing OOPS and the correct word.
For example, if you typed HAND THE CHAIN SAW TO GARNDMA and were told "[I don't
know the word 'garndma']" you could type OOPS GRANDMA rather than retyping the
entire sentence.

QUIT -- This lets you stop. If you want to save your position before quitting,
follow the instructions in the "Starting and Stopping" section on page 7. You
can abbreviate QUIT to Q.

RESTART -- This stops the story and starts it over from the beginning.

RESTORE -- This restores a previously saved position. See "Starting and
Stopping" on page 7 for more details.

SAVE -- This puts a "snapshot" of your current position on your storage disk.
You can return to a saved position in the future using the RESTORE command. See
"Starting and Stopping" on page 7 for more details.

SCRIPT -- This command tells your printer to begin making a transcript of the
story. A transcript may aid your memory, but is not necessary, and will only
work on certain computers. Read your Reference Card for details.

STATUS -- This command gives you the following information: your current mode
of descriptiveness, your score, a ranking based on that score, and the current
time in the story. Note that your score and the time can also be found on your
status line at the top of the screen.

SUPERBRIEF -- This command tells Stationfall to give you the sparest level of
description. See BRIEF above.

TIME -- This will give you the current time in the story.

UNSCRIPT -- This tells your printer to stop making a transcript.

VERBOSE -- This command tells Stationfall to give you the wordiest level of
description. See BRIEF above.

VERSION -- Stationfall responds by showing you the release number and the
serial number of your copy of the story. Please include this information if you
ever report a "bug" in the story.

WAIT -- This causes time in the story to pass. Since nothing happens until you
type a sentence and press RETURN (or ENTER), you could leave your computer,
take a trip to Rigel Seven, then return to the story to find that nothing has
changed. You can use WAIT to make time pass in the story without doing
anything. For example, if you met an alien robot, you might WAIT to see if it
will say anything; if you were aboard a moving space scooter, you might WAIT to
see where it goes. You can abbreviate WAIT to Z.

Tips for Novices

1. Draw a map. It should include each location and the connections to
adjoining locations. When you find yourself in a new place, make note of any
interesting objects there. (See the small sample map that goes along with the
sample transcript on page 4.) Remember, there are 10 possible directions
(NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTHEAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, UP, and
DOWN) plus IN and OUT.

2. EXAMINE all objects you come across in the story.

3. TAKE and carry as much as you can carry. Most objects that you find are
important for solving one or more of the puzzles you'll run into.

4. SAVE your place often, so that if you mess up or get "killed," you won't
have to start over from the beginning. See page 7 for more instructions.

5. Read the story carefully! There are often clues in the descriptions of
locations and objects.

6. Try everything you can think of - even strange or dangerous actions are fun
and may provide clues; you can always save your position first. Here's a silly
example:

>GIVE THE BASKETBALL TO THE LION
The lion takes an experimental bite out of the basketball but spits it out. It
continues to gnaw on your leg.

Thus, you discover that giving something more edible to the lion (that slab of
raw meat?) might save your leg.

7. There are many possible routes to the end of Stationfall. If you get stuck
on one puzzle, move on to another. Some puzzles have more than one solution;
other puzzles don't need to be solved at all. Sometimes you will have to solve
one puzzle in order to obtain the item(s) or information you need to solve
another puzzle.

8. Play Stationfall with a friend! As the dual-brained worm beasts of Nebulon
are fond of saying, "Two heads are better than one."

9. If you get completely stumped, you can order a hint booklet and map using
the order form in your package. You don't need this booklet to enjoy the story,
but it will help you solve the puzzles.

10. Read the sample transcript on page 4 to get a feel for how interactive
fiction works.

11. You can word a command in many different ways. For example, if you wanted
to make a wish, you could type in any of the following:

>DROP THE COIN DOWN THE WISHING WELL
>TOSS THE COIN INTO THE WELL
>PUT COIN IN WELL

If you type a sentence that Stationfall doesn't understand, try rephrasing it
or using synonyms. If Stationfall still doesn't understand, you're probably
trying something that isn't important for completing the story.

Common Complaints

Stationfall will complain if your input confuses it completely. Stationfall
would then ignore any further sentences on your input line. (Certain events,
such as being attacked, will also cause Stationfall to ignore any additional
sentences on your input line, since the event may have changed your situation
drastically.) Some of Stationfall's complaints:

I don't know the word "_______".
That word is not in the story's vocabulary. Sometimes using a synonym or
rephrasing will help; more likely, you're just barking up the wrong tree.
Stationfall recognizes over 800 words, all that you need to use and most that
you're likely to use. However, Stationfall uses many words in its descriptions
that it will not recognize in your inputs. Thus, you might read, "The moon
casts violet shadows across the crater." but discover that Stationfall doesn't
understand the words MOON or SHADOW or CRATER in your input. When this happens,
you can assume that you don't need to refer to those things to complete the
story; they are only there to create a more vivid image of your location.

You used the word "_______" in a way that I don't understand.
Stationfall knows the word but couldn't use it in that sense. Usually this is
because Stationfall knows it as a different part of speech. For example, if you
typed GO TO THE LOWER LEVEL, you are using LOWER as an adjective, but
Stationfall might know LOWER only as a verb, as in LOWER THE ROPE.

There was no verb in that sentence!
Unless you are answering a question, each sentence must have a verb (or one of
the special commands). Among the most important verbs that Stationfall
understands are TAKE, DROP, PUT, GIVE, LOOK, READ, EXAMINE, OPEN, CLOSE, ENTER,
EXIT, EAT and WEAR. There are many more. Remember, you can use a variety of
prepositions with your verbs. (For example, LOOK can become LOOK AT, LOOK
INSIDE, LOOK BEHIND, LOOK UNDER, LOOK THROUGH, and so on.)

There seems to be a noun missing in that sentence.
This usually means your sentence was incomplete, such as EAT THE BLUE or PUT
THE BOOK IN THE.

There were too many nouns in that sentence.
An example is CARVE MY INITIALS ON THE TREE WITH THE KNIFE, which has three
noun "phrases," one more than Stationfall can digest in a single action.

I beg your pardon?
You pressed the RETURN (or ENTER) key without typing anything.

You can't see any ______ here!
The object you referred to was not visible. It may be somewhere else, or it may
be present but in a closed container.

The other object[s] that you mentioned isn't [aren't] here.
You referred to several objects in the same sentence, and at least one wasn't
visible.

You can't use multiple [in]direct objects with "_______".
You can use multiple objects (that is, nouns or noun phrases separated by AND
or a comma) or the word ALL only with certain verbs, such as TAKE, DROP, and
PUT. For example, EXAMINE will not work with multiple objects; you couldn't say
EXAMINE ALL or EXAMINE THE BOWL AND THE SWORD.

That sentence isn't one I recognize.
Usually, this means that the syntax (sentence structure) you used is not among
the 300 or so syntaxes that Stationfall understands. For example, SIT UNDER THE
TREE and SKIP AROUND THE MAYPOLE are syntaxes that wouldn't be recognized by
Stationfall. There's a limited amount of space in the program, so syntaxes that
are less common or not useful aren't included. Try rephrasing the sentence.

Quick Reference Guide

1. To start the story ("boot up"), see the separate Reference Card in your
Stationfall package.

2. When you see the prompt (>) on your screen, Stationfall is waiting for your
input. There are four kinds of sentences or commands that Stationfall
understands:

A. Directions: To move from place to place, just type the direction you want to
go: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTHEAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, UP,
DOWN, IN, or OUT.

B. Actions: Just type what you want to do. Some examples: READ THE BOOK or OPEN
THE DOOR or LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW or GIVE THE BALL TO THE CAT. More complex
sentences are described in "Communicating with Infocom's Interactive Fiction"
on page 8.

C. Commands to other characters: Talk to characters in the story by typing
their name, then a comma, then what you want to say to them. For example: FRED,
HI or OLD MAN, GIVE ME THE TROMBONE.

D. Special commands: These give you information, such as INVENTORY, or affect
the state of the program, such as VERBOSE. A list of these appears in the
"Special Commands" section on page 9.

3. After typing your input, you must press the RETURN (or ENTER) key before
Stationfall will respond.

4. Your screen will display a special line called the status line. It tells you
your current location, your score, and the current time (if known).

5. You can pick up and carry many of the items you'll find in the story. For
example, if you type TAKE THE TUBE OF JELLY, you will then be carrying it.
Type INVENTORY to see what items you have.

6. When you want to stop, save your place in the story, or start over, read
"Starting and Stopping" on page 7.

7. If you have trouble, refer to the specific section of the manual for more
