	.GSTR STR?405,"This is the notebook of a certain Professor Schmidt, who was studying a strange pyramid discovered aboard a derelict alien ship and brought here.
   Schmidt traced back the path of the alien ship; the path points out of the galaxy without nearing any star system. Further, extending the path leads straight to one of our smaller neighboring galaxies. Schmidt concludes that the ship and the pyramid are probably well over one billion years old!
   Next, Schmidt studied the wall markings in the alien ship. A series of identical dots, they defied every computerized model of linguistic decipherment! Then, in an inspiration, Schmidt studied the dots for nonvisual properties. His diary vaguely refers to a breakthrough, saying, ""I guess my pal, the mayor, will get to show off his linguistic training.""
   Finally, Schmidt began concentrating his studies on the pyramid itself. He was able to discover very little, blaming this primarily on the unexplained failures of several crucial pieces of lab machinery."
	.GSTR STR?393,"This is the place where a station's exports are prepared before transfer to the docking bays and subsequent shipment throughout the regional sector. Hanging above a large vacant section of the room is an eye-catching sign. The only exit is west."
	.GSTR STR?374,"This is the primary storage room of the station, with large stockpiles of important items. For example, basic organic materials are needed to supplement the food supply due to the tiny inefficiencies of the recycling process. This is nearly the top level of the Command Module, and the ceiling curves in sharply over the supply room, which curves around to doors at the northwestern and southwestern ends."
	.GSTR STR?381,"This is the rather ordinary sanitary facility for the barracks to the north."
	.GSTR STR?356,"This is the room where octuplet copies of forms are stored. Since it's only a hundred square meters, this room cannot hold more than a few days' worth of storage before being dumped to nanofilm. Mercifully, there is an exit to the northeast."
	.GSTR STR?349,"This is the shop for station personnel, selling everything from postcards to chewing gum at inflated prices. Exits lead west and southwest."
	.GSTR STR?362,"This is the Station Commander's conference room. Doors point north and west."
	.GSTR STR?382,"This is the station's largest docking bay. A huge door to the east leads into the station.
   Resting in the docking bay is a small ship of obviously alien origin. An open hatch seems to beckon you inward."
	.GSTR STR?386,"This is the station's smallest docking bay. You can enter the station to the east."
	.GSTR STR?406,"This laboratory conducts research into various space-related physical sciences. Gangways lead up and down, and there's a door to the north."
	.GSTR STR?403,"This laboratory, which fills most of the middle level of the Sub-Module, is for the study of applications of the various space-related research that takes place on the other levels. Gangways lead up and down, and a door leads north. A connecting tube opens to the south."
	.GSTR STR?444,"This large spacetube is the main thoroughfare of a space village which has sprung up here on the outskirts of the space station, which lies to the north. Rather than the bustling thoroughfare you might expect, however, there isn't a soul in sight. Openings lead up, northeast, south and west. To the southeast, the ""street"" narrows and ramps downward."
	.GSTR STR?439,"This living bubble has been set up as an artist's loft. Most of the space is taken up by a large scrap sculpture floating in the center of the bubble. It is, of course, pretty impossible to tell how close the sculpture is to completion. The way out is to the east."
	.GSTR STR?426,"This moderately large store sells all kinds of games and other recreational materials. There is also an in-house rec area, featuring a group of simulation booths. The ""street"" lies to the southwest."
	.GSTR STR?464,"This outdated drydock is now a messy junk yard. A huge pile of floating junk fills the center of the bubble. Passages lead upwards and west."
	.GSTR STR?446,"This permanently-docked one-man ship serves as the office for Hizzoner the Mayor, the unofficial leader of the village. Main Street is below."
	.GSTR STR?460,"This physician's bubble is owned by the village quack, known to his friends as ""Doc"" Schuster, but known to the vast majority of the villagers as Schuster the Shyster. There's a small hole in the wall, probably the opening for a disposal chute. The Doc is out, and in this case, out is northwest."
	.GSTR STR?402,"This shiny cylindrical corridor is the connector between the Command Module, to the south, and the Scientific Sub-Module, to the north."
	.GSTR STR?435,"This shop, with exits to the northeast and southeast, sells a variety of animals. Many a lonely spacer has discovered the joys a pet can bring, and this shop features animals of both terrestrial and alien origin. A large sign advertises this month's special."
	.GSTR STR?373,"This sixty-seat auditorium is used for lectures, certain large briefings, an occasional live entertainment, and a rare live broadcast over deep-space channels. A projection booth dominates the rear of the room. The theatre's only exit is to the north."
	.GSTR STR?450,"This small space bubble, with openings to the east and southeast, is decorated with posters of exotic locales, but it's hard to imagine that anyone in this rundown spacetown would be able to afford an interstellar pleasure jaunt."
	.GSTR STR?437,"This sprawling old cargo ship, its engines long ago cannibalized for spare parts, has been converted into a store for supplies and curios. There's an eye-catching sign on the wall. Passageways lead in many directions, and there's an opening in the floor."
	.GSTR STR?377,"This station's library has some printed material, such as recently transmitted magazines, but primarily it is a location for reading nanofilm spools, using the spool reader here, and for accessing the main computer's data banks via a computer terminal. Strangely, the computer terminal has been removed. There's a door to the north and an exit to the west."
	.GSTR STR?418,"This tiny control station allows access to the massive memory banks of the station's computer. Ever since the formation of the Third Galactic Union ended the great interstellar dark age, every Stellar Patrol spaceship, every Patrol space station, has been equipped with a computer bulging with the entire accumulated knowledge of mankind. Never again will humanity be permitted to slip back into the ignorance and savagery of the dark age.
   A ladder leads up to Level Eight, and there's a call button next to the elevator shaft to the north."
	.GSTR STR?368,"This warren of tiny cubicles fills the southern half of this level, curving toward exits in the northeast and northwest corners."
	.GSTR STR?34,"Through the large, dirty window, you can see Dan's used spaceship lot. The spaceships floating in Dan's lot all have their prices whitewashed on their viewports, along with phrases like ""A steal!"" and ""Just reduced!"""

The corridor continues starboard and a room lies aft. Beyond the door to port lies the bulk of the Duffy. Next to the door is a slot."
	.GSTR STR?468,"You are strolling across Deck Four of the Duffy, when suddenly you remember that you were supposed to have Handwriting Legibility Evaluation Forms -- all nine parts, for every member of the crew -- on Captain Fussbottom's desk by 7800. It's 7790, and those forms are stored on the other side of the ship. You try to run, but the floor is covered with glue.
