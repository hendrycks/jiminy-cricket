Gazing Into the Orb

They came to Antharia from all corners of the kingdom: Gurth and Mithicus, the Frigid River Valley, Borphee,
even the Gray Mountains. They packed the restaurants, and for the first time in 150 years the Rusty Knife in West
Anthar ran out of sea-serpent fillet. They completely filled the Zilton Hotel, and in three days spent an estimated
Zm20,000 on marble trinkets, Bella Quease souvenirs, Flathead Stadium tickets, and Spenseweed shakes. Yet despite
the success of the tourist trade, the pageantry, and the beautiful weather, the 115th Convention of Enchanters and
Sorcerers (CES) was an unqualified disaster.
Why? "There’s too much showing-off, too much one-upmanship between the chapters, and no cooperation," said
Barbel of Gurth, a Guildmaster and elder member of the Circle of Enchanters. "We’re here to share and exchange our
advancements in thaumaturgy, and to try to solve our common problems, not to compete against each other in some
sort of free-for-all. Frankly, I’m disgusted." And so are we.
Conventioneers at CES seemed totally unwilling to discuss, much less resolve the problems facing the Guild of
Enchanters in and around Thriff, the crippling shortage of Enchanters in the Gray Mountains, the grumblings of some
junior Sorcerers about "leadership stagnation," the spiralling costs of an Enchanter’s education, the pros and cons of
regulating magic potion distribution ... all these issues and more could have benefited from an open dialog among the
chapters. Instead, the assembled Enchanters, whose reputation for sobriety and consideration is generally welldeserved,
indulged shamelessly on Phlog and Tonics, and made an overall nuisance of themselves.
"This is great!" said one apprentice from the Gurth City chapter, after he had happily cast the ZOOKA spell
("turn eggs into overripe cabbage") just as the Thriff chapter sat down to breakfast. Moments later, someone (probably
from the Thriff chapter) cast the STEGAW spell ("turn eggs into ripe guano") at the Gurth City chapter breakfast,
whose members thereafter were unable to keep anything down.
Such pranks may seem harmless, but they do little to improve communication between the chapters. They can
also get out of hand. During the opening ceremonies on the first evening of CES, for instance, an Enchanter from
Aragain cast the FILFRE spell ("display gratuitous fireworks") inside Convention Hall; literally dozens of other
Enchanters subsequently cast FILFRE inside the hall, each trying to outdo the other. Not surprisingly, the old wooden
hall caught fire. Just as someone would cast the GONDAR spell ("extinguish fire"), someone else would claim a
"better" or "improved" GONDAR spell and restart the fire to display their talents. This went on for nearly an hour
before order was called, and the hall suffered much damage.
The Guild of Enchanters has successfully regulated itself for hundreds of years. It helped bring stability to the
land following the turbulence of the Great Underground Empire’s collapse, and today underwrites many fine
philanthropic foundations. How ironic and disappointing, then, that it can’t turn its wisdom and wonder unto itself, and
behave in a more professional and responsible manner, to address its serious problems and ensure a healthier future for
us all.

LETTERS
TO THE EDITOR
To the editor:
In your otherwise excellent article on the
FILFRE spell, you neglected to mention
its derivation. FILFRE is a modification
of the expression "Feel Free," which
perhaps explains its unrestrained use
among some Enchanters.
P.D.L., Borphee
To the editor:
So Orkan of Thriff is now selling wand
racks? He’s a Guildmaster, not a
carpenter! Next thing you know, actors
will be selling salad dressing.
H.D.A., Accardi
To the editor:
I’m sure many of your readers would be
surprised to learn that there are some
remote areas of the Empire where people
still do not practice magic. An article
about these under-developed
communities would be quite amusing.
S.W.G., Mithicus
To the editor:
Your recent article entitled "Should
Enchanters in Glass Mazes Throw
Stones?" reminded me of a few other
age-old questions that perhaps modern
magic can answer: Which came first, the
time paradox or the tamed parrot
Awkes? Is a zorkmid truly the root of
boll weevils? If the land were the sky
and the sky were the land, would things
fall up and grow down?

BELBOZ AT 200:
Is Retirement in his Future?
Recently, Belboz the Necromancer was lecturing to a senior class at G.U.E. Tech’s School of Enchantment in
Greater Borphee. The great thaumaturge departed from his prepared text on "The Baffling Behavior of Babbling Baby
Brogmoids Biting Broccoli" to discuss Enchanter’s Ethics, a hot issue in magical circles these days, and he gave a
predictably levelheaded perspective.
"What are the criteria for determining which actions are morally right and morally wrong? The most famous
answer is that power and might are never wrong. But can beauty, happiness, or fireworks be ignored? Certainly not.
Doing the decent thing in the face of many juicy and despicable alternatives takes enormous willpower and always
arouses the skepticism of others. And an orator who sprinkles a speech with flowery and vivid images to keep his
audience glued to their seats is no more ethical than a Sorcerer who casts the FOBLUB spell to achieve the same
ends."
Leaders espousing moderation or temperance are rarely heard or heeded at our universities in these dreary times,
yet Belboz received a 30-minute sitting ovation from his audience. (Belboz had in fact used the FOBLUB spell on the
audience, gluing them to their seats.) Such is the respect and esteem accorded to this wise, crinkly-eyed master
Sorcerer, who turns 200 years of age this month.
Belboz is well-known as a model Sorcerer, an exemplar for all young Enchanters. Born an orphan near Aragain
Falls in the Frigid River Valley, he was the eldest of six brothers and sisters. His guardian uncle, a well-to-do but
simple-minded cave digger, tried to get young Belboz interested in construction work, but Belboz talked only about
magic, reading everything he could find on the subject. His uncle finally relented and sent Belboz to Borphee Harbor,
where he was tutored by a master magician for the next 20 years. ("My uncle thought thaumaturgy was a
communicable fish disease, and fancied I sat on a dock for 20 years telling carp to open wide and say ’ah,’" says
Belboz.) He then spent a 30-year apprenticeship in the Accardi Chapter of the Guild of Enchanters, became a fullfledged
Enchanter in 820 GUE, and traveled south to Gurth and Mithicus, where he pioneered research on anti-caking
additives to magic potions. His success in perfecting dozens of spells, notably the LOBAL spell ("sharpen hearing")
and the CONBAK spell ("build strong bodies 12 different ways") brought him interprovincial fame and heralded his
advancement to sorcerer after a mere 25 years. Unlike his peers, Belboz criticized the decadence of the royal family
and foretold the collapse of the Great Underground Empire. Most fellow Sorcerers thought Belboz’s warnings were
shrill or foolish, but when the Empire did collapse in 883, Belboz said "I told you so." Belboz then returned to Accardi
where, in 910, at the age of 153, he became Guildmaster of the Accardi Chapter. Perhaps his greatest success--
certainly his most publicized--came in 952, when he destroyed the evil giant Amathradonis. Later that year he became
the kingdomwide Secretary of the Guild of Enchanters, a post which he has held now for two terms.
With a life expectancy of 175 years, almost three times that of a layperson, most Sorcerers retire from the Guild
and become Magicians Emeritus or Conjuration Consultants long before they become bicentenarians. At 200, Belboz
is the oldest member of the Circle of Enchanters, and is the oldest guildmaster ever. Speculation is rampant, then,
whether the master Sorcerer has any plans to retire.
"We-l-l-l-l," the necromancer pondered last week during an interview with POPULAR ENCHANTING, "I would
like to travel. I haven’t crossed the Flathead Ocean for over a century. I’d also be interested in visiting more chapters of
the Guild; our flummox in Antharia [see the editorial on page 2] clearly shows we need to get our house in order. And
certainly I’d like to be able to do more fishing. But I am, really, just approaching my prime. Even though I am old, my
strengths and powers are at their peak."
Asked whether he thought his age impeded his work, Belboz chuckled, "All Enchanters have youth-casting
spells, of course, which accounts for our longevity. I have naturally improved upon these. But I’ve seen some 100-yearold
Enchanters who think older than I do, and therefore they are older than I am. A youth-casting spell affects the body
but not the mind. It is worthless if its subject has on old mind."
"Leadership stagnation" is a term that has been bandied about lately by a number of junior Sorcerers, who feel
that the lifetime appointment of Guildmasters is too long. "Guildmasters are like king, only worse," says a Sorcerer
who requests anonymity. "A chapter dangles the Guildmaster post before its members like bait, enticing them to
dedicate their life’s work and devotion for it. A chapter selects a new Guildmaster only once in 30, 40, even 50 years.
All the qualified Sorcerers who don’t get chosen adopt a negative attitude knowing they’ll never be Guildmasters." This
negative attitude, some say is passed on to Enchanters, who pass it on to apprentices, like some communicable fish
disease. While no one mentions Belboz’s name specifically, his 47-year tenure as Guildmaster is an obvious target of
such complaints.
"I disagree completely with the idea that we dangle the Guildmaster’s post like bait, and it’s simply not true that
all other qualified Sorcerers adopt a negative attitude," says Belboz. "I agree there may be some advantages to limiting
the term of a Guildmaster. But I am most upset that a Sorcerer would take offense at not being chosen Guildmaster. A
Sorcerer should be above such lowly, jealous, and power-hungry thoughts, and anyone who thinks them deserves to be
turned into a newt."
So fear not, Belboz fans: The great necromancer is not ready to quit. "Ask me about my retirement again,"
Belboz told us, "when I turn 300."

SPECIAL BOOK EXCERPT: 
Spells and the Single Sorcerer
by Wilbar Memboob
[This is the second of three excerpts to appear in POPULAR
ENCHANTING magazine. Last month’s installment
dismissed many of the myths surrounding single Sorcerers,
among them the common notion that single Sorcerers like
granola. This month’s installment is adapted from chapter
"Friendship... and More," and discusses the importance of
making a good first impression. The final excerpt, discussing
such practical matters as spells for single-serving potions
and Solitaire Fanucci, will appear next month. Wilbar
Memboob is the author of "The Joy of Spells" and "The
Enchanter Never Rings Twice: 101 Uses for REZROV."]
Many otherwise fine and distinguished Sorcerers are shy or
ugly, or, generally, both. This does not mean, however, that
they must lead a solitary existence or abstain from the
simple pleasures of courtship. Several thaumaturgical
suppliers sell a wide assortment of self-improvement spells
and potions, and unless you are "kobold ugly," most will
work with few or no unpleasant side effects.
It is impossible to predict when a particular selfimprovement
spell or potion will be needed (unless one is a
very, very good Sorcerer). carrying a six-pack of assorted
potions can therefore save a situation. For instance, suppose
you were walking beside a field of blossoming dragondils,
and you met an attractive person of the opposite sex. Should
this person remark "Aren’t the dragondils lovely," you might
reply:
"Oh, is that what they are?"
or simply
"Yes."
or, worse, "I’ve seen nicer."
But if you had in your possession the SIRANO potion, you
might surreptitiously quaff it and reply:
"As lovely and golden as the rain-washed air is clear and
sparkling, and fragrant and fresh as you eyes are poetic and
inspiring."
You must of course realize that you get what you pay for.
Some so-called "discount" or "bargain" potions are no
bargain at all. A SIRANO potion that wears off midsentence
can be disastrous, as you’re likely to say the first
thing that comes to your mind, which is bound to be
ridiculous:
"Your lips are like rubies, your eyes like alabaster,
your hands like...like poached rotgrub."
Once you have captured your new acquaintance’s
attention with a charming or witty remark, you must act fast!
Many Sorcerers cast the FAIFT spell ("change appearance to
look younger" ) on themselves. This is generally a mistake.
If your face is reminiscent of a frog, you will suddenly look
like a tadpole; if you’re overweight, you may become a
piglet. A better strategy is to cast the IMALI spell ("worsen
eyesight") on your friend. The spell is painless and
temporary, and should your dupe comment upon blurry
vision, you might remember Elvis Flathead’s hit "Love is
Blind," and suggest that your kind-hearted spell in fact
prevented total blindness.
Before I am accused of condoning deceit as the basis
for a relationship, let me state outright that the casting of
spells--on yourself or on your partner--is permissible only
for the first few days of a relationship. If you cannot keep
your acquaintance’s interest without magic, then you should
let go and part ways. Particularly reprehensible are reports of
Sorcerers casting body-deforming spells like BAYALA and
MUSDEX on an unwilling partner to satisfy a personal
preference.

The Power of Positive Conjuring: Learning with GNUSTO 
To the lay person, the GNUSTO spell is unspectacular. There are no
loud noises, no pyrotechnics, no feelings of euphoria when it is cast,
no changes in the environment, no great insights into the worlds --
nothing to indicate that it is one of the cornerstones of thaumaturgy as
practiced today. Yet it enables Enchanters to cast and recast spells
countless times reliably and effectively, freeing up magicians’ time
for research into new and improved spells, and bringing magic to the
people, thus indirectly improving the health and welfare of the
general populace.
A few old-fashioned Sorcerers show contempt or impatience
with the GNUSTO spell, preferring instead to cast spells directly from
scrolls rather than writing them into a book first. "There’s no danger,
no excitement anymore," says a retired Sorcerer from Mithicus who
wishes to remain anonymous. "In the good old days, you had to be
careful when you used your spell. They were good only once, so you
couldn’t go around turning every unfriendly critter that crossed your
path into an newt. Nowadays, Enchanters use CLEESH first and ask
questions later."
But such disdain for the GNUSTO spell is increasingly rare,
since most Sorcerers were born after its discovery and grew up
accepting and enjoying it. In fact, the "safety net" feature of
GNUSTO does not make the Enchanter’s life less exciting, but gives
the Enchanter the opportunity to use a particularly handy spell more
than once. Certainly no one argues that spells cast directly from
scrolls are easier to use or are more effective; spells copied into books
with GNUSTO lose none of their complexity or potency.
One obvious shortcoming of GNUSTO is that it cannot write
extremely powerful magic spells into a spell book. Most scholars
believe that the GNUSTO spell itself is too weak, though the Spell
Science Lab at G.U.E. Tech is testing a very GNUSTO-receptive
paper which it hopes will be sensitive enough to allow even the most
ancient and mighty spell to be copied.
What does the future have in store for GNUSTO? "I think it will
continue to be the most popular spell we manufacture," says a
spokesperson at United Thaumaturgy. "It’s certainly changed the
industry." That it has: Smoothscroll Draughtsmen, once the largest
supplier of common spell scrolls, now markets such diverse products
as glow-in-the-dark bookmarks and synthetic toad warts. In fact, the
only scrolls Smoothscroll now makes are high-priced custom-made
spell scrolls which are "GNUSTO-protected" to prevent unauthorized
copying. Spellshack recently unveiled its OTSUNG spell ("erase spell
written in book with GNUSTO"). And International Business Magic
is trying to transfer the "safety net" properties of GNUSTO to a new
spell that would work on magic potions.

In Sorcerer, second in the Enchanter series, the fate of the kingdom is once again in your hands.
You are a gifted Enchanter, whose skillful and cunning use of magic enabled you to defeat the Evil Warlock, Krill. This victory earned you a place in the elite Circle of Enchanters, where you sit next to your mentor, the great Belboz the Necromancer. During the past several years, you become one of his favorite pupils, but over the last few days you've perceived certain subtle, sinister changes in his personality.
Now Belboz has vanished, leaving behind only a cryptic diary. You must search for him through mazes and mines and the treacherous mists of time. Only your cleverness and magical abilities can rescue Belboz from whatever evil has befallen him and save the Circle of Enchanters from destruction.

BLOODWORM
Bloodworms live in shallow underground pools of
water and are often mistaken for mossy boulders.
Their pointy, retractable fangs can extend up to
32 inches during an attack. They are repelled by the
smell of boiled chives; always carry some if venturing
near known bloodworm spawning grounds. Bloodworms
are usually white and gray and black and red
and black.

BROGMOID
In rare cases, these squat creatures can achieve the
intelligence level of a three-year-old human. Domesticated
brogmoids are tame and can even be
taught to perform simple tasks. In the wild, they can be
seen in huge packs sorting through rock piles for edible
rocks. Brogmoids (which live considerably longer
in captivity) are red and purple and red and black
and purple.

DORN
The deadly dorn beast should be avoided at all
costsit can paralyze its victim with a single
glare from its powerful eyes. (Range: about three
feet for young beastlings to about 20 feet for full-grown
dorns.) Dorns usually live in crags and shadows near
cliff bases. According to the last words of dying
explorers, dorns are gray and purple and black and gray
and white.

DRYAD
Dryads, also known as tree sprites, are beautiful
and shy. Many never leave the shade of the tree
they were born under. If coaxed, dryads can
reveal the location of forest treasures. They are only
dangerous in large numbers, and then only if threatened.
(Angered dryads have been known to crush attackers
under tons of rose petals.) When awake, dryads are
black and gray and white and red and red.

GRUE
The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark
places of the earth. Its favorite diet is Enchanters,
but its insatiable appetite is tempered
by its fear of light. No grue has ever been seen by the
light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws to
tell the tale. Toxicologists believe that grues are black
and black and red and black and purple.

HELLHOUND
When you spot a hellhound, run in the other
direction as fast as you can! Hellhounds are
fast, fierce and capable of devouring a human
12 times their size in 3½ seconds. They normally
inhabit burnt-out or enchanted woods and rarely venture
beyond their turf, even in pursuit of prey. Hellhounds
are purple and white and gray and red and gray.

KOBOLD
Kobolds are very capable fighters. If attacked,
they will fight back; if not attacked, they will
fight back anyway. They look very similar to the
less aggressive paskalds, but can be easily identified
because their middle toe is slightly shorter than the
toes that flank it. Kobolds live in small tribes in caverns
or in very dark forests and are red and purple and black
and purple and red.

NABIZ
Nabiz are mostly mouth, which is mostly teeth.
They instinctively sense their enemys weakest
point when attacking. Contrary to folklore, they
cannot fly, but they can leap tremendous distances.
Nabiz are repulsed by the color blue, which explains
that colors popularity in adventurers garb. Nabiz are
purple and black and black and black and red.

ORC
Once a fearsome race of warriors, the Orcs were
civilized by their fondness for computerized
adventure games. Although a small segment (the
Hi-Res Orcs) enjoy graphic adventures, the vast majority
(the Orcs of Zork) prefer interactive fiction. In the
reflected light of a CRT screen, Orcs appear to be red
and gray and purple and gray and red.

ROTGRUB
Less than an inch long, the rotgrub lies waiting in
food. Once ingested, the rotgrub heads straight
for its victims brain and begins feeding. Rotgrub
death is excruciatingly painful and lasts years before a
welcome demise. They are totally impervious to all
forms of magic, and, even worse, smell like very old
cheese. A common house rotgrub is gray and red and
gray and purple and red.

SURMIN
From their malodorous breath to their lice-ridden
fur, surmins are utterly repulsive creatures. If they
get close enough, they can bore their victims to
death by reciting Greater Borphee County Penal
Codes. A newly shaved surmin is black and black and
purple and red and black.

YIPPLE
The yipple is a master of disguise, able to alter
form to match its surroundings. If disturbed in
the wild, some yipples may bite. They make
wonderful pets, but should never be allowed to rest in
the cookie jar if guests are expected. Yipples are
violently allergic to many kinds of animal wastes. When
placed on a plain white tablecloth, yipples become gray
and purple and white and purple and black.
