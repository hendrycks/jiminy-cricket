     rutabagas on the ledge outside the window.
  D. There is no attic, window, owl, or pile of rutabagas.
  E. Remember the warning in the introduction: Do not let the presence or

     Floyd's location.
  B. Is anyone missing or perhaps in trouble?
  C. Try casting it on Belboz.
  D. Since Belboz is quite distant (as you can tell by examining the amulet
     while still in the Guild Hall), and possibly protected by magical
     spells, AIMFIZ does't transport you to his exact location. However, it
     does take you to his vicinity (look at the amulet after AIMFIZing).

  B. Where is the front door of the Guild Hall?

Can I survive in maze rooms that don't have a floor?

How do I get back from the Hollow?
  A. The only way back is through the glass maze.
  B. You'll need the FWEEP spell to get back through it.
  C. So you'd better memorize it more than once before you enter the maze
     from Outside the Glass Arch.
  D. In fact, once the maze has re-arranged itself, you'll need a total of
     three FWEEPs to make the round trip.
  E. There's a much easier and quicker way, although some players may find
     it inelegant. GASPAR yourself at Outside the Glass Arch. Then, get
     "killed" in the Hollow or the maze.

  B. It involves entering the maze.
  C. It involves flying.

     pursue you, and plummet.
  E. Flying from the Hollow, go W.W.S.E.

Is the brick structure of any significance?
     Yes.


The Amusement Park
******************

How can I enter the park?

     Park Entrance.

     zorkmid.
  C. You can get a zorkmid coin from the area beyond the chasm near the
     Crater.

  D. There's nothing important about the Roller Coaster.

What is the significance of the Arcade?

  B. But the hawker and his game booth are important.

  B. TAKE THE BALL and then THROW THE BALL AT THE BUNNIES.

How does the odd machine work?

  B. It is a slot machine.
  C. If three identical symbols appear in the windows, you will get a
     payoff. This happens (on the average) one out of every sixteen tries.

     Unfortunately, this is fatal. This happens (on the average) one out of
     every sixty-four tries.
  E. Otherwise, the payoff is one zorkmid coin. This happens (on the
     average) three out of every sixty-four tries. If you paid off the park
     gnome before paying the toll gnome, this is the only way to get a coin
     for the toll.
  F. For a better way to pay both gnomes, read the first question in this
     section.


The Coal Mine

  A. The person looks just like you, only more dishevelled.
  B. It is your own older self.
  C. There must be some time travel going on here.

Should I give my spell book to my "twin"?
     It makes sense to trust your older self, since your interests are
     almost certainly mutual. After all, where would your older self be if
     you went and got yourself "killed"?

Can I make a map of the coal mine?
  A. Yes, but you don't have much time until vilstu wears off.
  B. Dropping an object in each room of the coal mine will individualize it,
     and thus making a map of the area will be easier.
  C. There are only three rooms called Coal Mine, but sometimes a passage
     returns to the same room that it left from.

Can I go down the coal chute at Top of Chute?
     Sure. DOWN or ENTER THE CHUTE will do it.

  B. Temporal travel means traveling in time.

     the Coal Bin Room.
  D. CAST GOLMAC ON ME, then go DOWN to the Coal Bin Room.

What is the purpose of the kerosene lamp?
  A. It lights the Slanted Room.
  B. Something unusual happens when you GOLMAC in the Slanted Room.
  C. After casting GOLMAC on yourself, OPEN THE LAMP.
  D. The smelly scroll wasn't there when you arrived, because you yourself
     removed it the "last time through" the cycle.

What happened to the objects I dropped into the coal chute at Top of Chute?
     When you drop objects into the upper coal chute, they land in the Coal
     Bin Room, where they get buried in the coal (except for a few large

The Lagoon Area
***************

Why did some of my possessions vanish as I entered the lower chute?
  A. You changed time in such a way that it became impossible for you to
     have those possessions.
  B. For example, you never told your younger self the combination, thus you
     yourself could never have been told it by your older self, thus you
     couldn't have objects from beyond the dial door.

Where are the objects I dropped into the lower chute in the Coal Bin Room?
     Objects that you drop into the lower chute end up at the bottom of the
     lagoon.

Can I get back up the lower coal chute?
     No.

Can I enter the lagoon?
  A. Try going east from the Lagoon Shore.
  B. "If you want to enter the lagoon, say so."
  C. Try ENTER THE LAGOON.

Is there anything significant about the lagoon?
  A. Yes.
  B. Have you gone DOWN to the floor of the lagoon?
  C. Lovely clump of spenseweeds, eh? (It would be a shame if anything
     happened to them.)
  D. MEEF THE SPENSEWEEDS.

How can I breathe underwater?
  A. You can survive only a few turns underwater.
  B. Naturally, the vilstu potion will allow you to stay underwater as long
     as it lasts.
  C. But if you've solved the coal mine problem, you've already used up the
     vilstu potion.
  D. Fortunately, you need to be underwater for only a few turns.
  E. And, you can always go up for air and dive back down.

How can I take the wooden crate?
  A. It's pretty heavy.
  B. You'll probably have to drop everything else before you try to move it.
  C. You probably can't move it if you're tired.

How can I climb the cliffs?
  A. The cliffs are unclimbable.
  B. The cliffs are too tall to fly over.
  C. The cliffs are bigger than a breadbox.
  D. The cliffs are not made of marzipan.
  E. The cliffs are a good subject for a long, useless question.

How can I enter the ocean?
  A. Have you tried going EAST from the shore of the ocean?
  B. "Entering the ocean is certain death."
  C. Have you tried ENTER THE OCEAN?
  D. As advertised, "Certain death."

How can I cross the river at its mouth?
  A. It has a big mouth.
  B. In other words, there's no way.

How can I enter the cave with the vines?
  A. The vines are deadly.
  B. Fortunately, they are susceptible to magic.
  C. Try the MEEF spell.

Omigosh! A pack of grues! What should I do?
  A. Light usually takes care of grues, but these are mutated.
  B. Have you found the Frobozz Magic Grue Protection Kit?
  C. It's on the Lagoon Floor. See the lagoon question.
  D. What you need is inside the crate.
  E. The lamp is useless, of course, because of the mutation.
  F. Either the grue suit or the repellent will suffice.
  G. SPRAY ME WITH REPELLENT or WEAR THE GRUE SUIT. (Warning: the repellent
     wears off after several turns!)

How can I destroy the machinery in the Mammoth Cavern?
  A. Have you tried DESTROY THE MACHINERY?
  B. You can't destroy the machinery.
  C. Instead, you should destroy the machinery operator: Jeearr.

Which door should I open?
  A. You could try all three...
  B. But a true Sorcerer in this situation probably wouldn't be able to SAVE
     and RESTORE.
  C. The VEZZA spell would be helpful here.
  D. Open the white wooden door.

How can I get out of the Hall of Eternal Pain?
  A. You can't.

How can I exorcise Belboz?
  A. Don't continue until you've seen Belboz.
  B. Don't continue until you've obtained the SWANZO spell.
  C. CAST SWANZO ON BELBOZ.
  D. Oops. Perhaps you'd better protect yourself first.
  E. Don't continue until you've obtained the VARDIK spell.
  F. CAST VARDIK ON ME then CAST SWANZO ON BELBOZ. Voila.

How can I kill Belboz?
  A. Kill your friend and mentor???
  B. The diamond-studded knife looks promising.
  C. Try KILL BELBOZ WITH THE KNIFE.
  D. Well, perhaps if you protected your own mind first...
  E. Don't continue until you've obtained the VARDIK spell.
  F. CAST VARDIK ON ME then KILL BELBOZ WITH THE KNIFE.
  G. Still not the optimum ending, right?
  H. You want to exorcise Belboz.


General Questions
*****************

Are potions liquids or powders?
     Yes.

What is a nymph?
     Look it up in the encyclopedia in the Library.

Is it okay to rifle through the belongings of fellow Enchanters?
  A. In general, that would not be proper behavior.
  B. But this is an emergency.

Where is it safe to sleep?
  A. The Guild Hall isn't safe until you've rescued Belboz.
  B. It's safe to sleep almost everywhere else.
  C. Some obvious exceptions: the river bed locations, inside the coal mine,
     Twisted Forest, Tree Branch, Snake Pit, Mine Field, Meadow, Drawbridge,
     River Bank, Hollow, Surface of Lagoon, Lagoon Floor, and Belboz's
     Hideout.
  D. You might want to try sleeping in those locations, just to see what
     happens...but do a SAVE first.

Are the dreams meaningful?
  A. No, none of the dreams contains any useful information.
  B. In fact, these dreams all appeared in Enchanter(tm), also.
  C. Perhaps you suffer from recurring dreams.

Is the YOMIN spell useful?
  A. Not really.
  B. It is sort of interesting to use, though.

What is guano?
     GUANO -- n. (gwan-o) A substance composed chiefly of excrement and used
     as fertilizer.

Where is the scroll with the ZIKKLE spell?
  A. The leader of the rockworm tribe can tell you.
  B. But first you need to learn rockworm speech.
  C. You can do that by reading the invisible carvings in the Hall of
     Carvings.
  D. You can make them visible using the ZIKKLE spell.

How can I dry out wet spell books and wet scrolls?
     You can't. Once your spell book or a scroll has gotten wet, it's
     useless.

Is the VEZZA spell important?
  A. It provides a few hints.
  B. But you could finish the game without ever using it.
  C. Note that two of the glimpses are previews of the third Enchanter game:
     the pile of white blocks, and the Guildmasters meeting in Borphee.

Why do I sometimes suddenly cease to exist?
  A. Don't continue unless you've used the GOLMAC spell.
  B. A time travel paradox is involved.
  C. One way to "poof" out of existence is to enter the lower chute after
     casting GOLMAC without informing your younger self of the combination.
     This sets up a paradox.
  D. Another way to "poof" is to cast GOLMAC on yourself a second time (the
     scroll re-appears on the ground of the Slanted Room when you GOLMAC). A
     second dose of this spell sends you too far back in time to meet your
     younger self, thus creating another paradox.
  E. Two other ways to "poof" are to leave the Slanted Room before casting
     GOLMAC, or to carry the shimmering scroll out of the Slanted Room.

How were the spells and potions named?
  A. GNUSTO, FROTZ, REZROV, and IZYUK are taken from Enchanter.
  B. FWEEP is the sound that the deranged bat in Zork I makes. Perhaps it is
     repeating the last word it ever heard as a human.
  C. AIMFIZ is ZIFMIA backwards. ZIFMIA, in Enchanter, causes someone to be
     transported to YOUR location.
  D. GOLMAC is short for gold machine, the time travel device in Zork III.
     The gold machine was probably imbued with this spell.
  E. YOMIN is an anagram of the name of an actor who played a famous
     mind-prober on a sci-fi TV show.
  F. MALYON is a corruption of Pygmalion, a sculptor who (according to
     ancient Greek legend) brought his creation to life.
  G. FOOBLE is a potential reset code in Suspended(tm).
  H. YONK is a reference to the author's birthplace.
  I. Some others are the names of Infocom employees.
