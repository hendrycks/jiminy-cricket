	.GSTR STR?247,"Tacked to the doorframe of your room is a note, hurriedly scribbled on parchment."
	.GSTR STR?259,"The calendar is for the current year, 957 GUE, and bears many stunning pictures: the marble mines of Antharia, the sand dunes of the Kovalli Desert, ancient Fort Griffspotter, and the giant infotater factories of Borphee. A legend reads ""Best wishes for a leak-less year, from the Accardi Plumbers Guild."""
	.GSTR STR?203,"The corpse comes to life just long enough to fry you."
	.GSTR STR?210,"The door swings open as a loud alarm sounds. Laser beams criss-cross the room, glinting off the blades of the thousand flying daggers. A hundred well-armed and vicious kobolds rush into the room, swinging battle axes."
	.GSTR STR?204,"The dorn beast fries your brain with its hypnotic gaze and begins secreting digestive juices."
	.GSTR STR?186,"The dragon comes to life again! He spews a tremendous gout of flame right at you!"
	.GSTR STR?249,"The first tenet states that Enchanters may never use their talents to aid evil. The second points out that an Enchanter's duty is to the Guild and to the Kingdom, not to the individual. Lesser tenets include rules for conducting votes at meetings, guidelines for passing dishes at Guild banquets, and penalties for revealing the Guild's secret handshake."
	.GSTR STR?268,"The forest is too dense to enter here."
	.GSTR STR?176,"The gate flies open, but the gnome immediately slams it shut again. ""Trying to gate crash, huh? We have an answer for scofflaws like you. Hey, Tholl!"" A troll lumbers out of the toll booth. ""This is Tholl the Toll Troll. Tholl, remove this cheat."" Tholl approaches and slices you neatly in half with his axe."

	.GSTR STR?19,"The izyuk spell wears off. Unfortunately, this room of the maze has no floor."
	.GSTR STR?322,"The maze opens here onto a tiny outdoor plateau, completely surrounded by towering cliffs. The only way out is back through the dazzling archway of glass to the west.
Near the glass arch is a small rectangular brick structure. The center of the structure is a hole about a foot wide, leading down into darkness."
	.GSTR STR?324,"The opening in the brick structure is too small for humans or even bats."
	.GSTR STR?239,"The personal journal of Belboz the Necromancer is lying here."
	.GSTR STR?10,"The pool evaporates, to the annoyance of a multi-tentacled denizen, who proceeds to take out its anger on you."
	.GSTR STR?468,"The rabbit hops obliviously as your throw sails far off target!"
	.GSTR STR?173,"The results are too hideous to describe."
	.GSTR STR?274,"The river bed ends here at a steep cliff, where the river once plunged over a waterfall. Below the falls, in the distance, is a large sea, covered with haze. The bed continues northwest, but the banks here are unclimbable. Atop the southwestern bank stands a proud fortress."
	.GSTR STR?273,"The river bed to the northwest is a pool covered with algae and other scum. The bed to the southeast is slightly drier. The banks are too tall and steep to climb here."
	.GSTR STR?346,"The river is too wide to cross."
	.GSTR STR?289,"The road curves here, heading east and southwest."
	.GSTR STR?255,"The servants have been lax lately, for a scroll is lying among the dust in the corner."
	.GSTR STR?293,"The tunnel turns a corner here. You could go either north or east."
	.GSTR STR?314,"The underground road ends here. A hovel, carved into the rock, lies to the east. To the north, wide marble stairs lead upward."
	.GSTR STR?349,"The very walls of this room seem to soak up all light, so it seems as though you're floating in the center of an infinite void."
	.GSTR STR?69,"The vilstu potion wears off as you sleep, and you awaken clawing frantically at your chest."
	.GSTR STR?219,"The vines encircle you and tear you limb from limb."
	.GSTR STR?327,"The walls and ceiling of this room are covered with soot and held up by timbers which don't look very sturdy. A winding tunnel leads north. From the east comes a sulfurous odor."
	.GSTR STR?182,"The waxer short circuits in the water, electrocuting you and several nearby fishies."
	.GSTR STR?318,"There is a marble statue here, in a strikingly life-like pose of pompous bellicosity."
	.GSTR STR?341,"There's a tall cliff there."
	.GSTR STR?348,"This cavern is of extraordinary size, but nevertheless crowded with powerful-looking machinery. You recognize a breeder for producing millions of the mutated grues you just passed. Other devices seem designed to aid the forces of evil while sapping magic powers of Enchanters everywhere.

At the far end of the cavern are three closed doors: a black marble door leading to the northwest, a shiny silver door heading due west, and a door of bleached white wood to the southwest."
	.GSTR STR?302,"This is a battlement with a view of a river to the north and an ocean to the east. Openings northwest, west, and southwest lead to other parts of the fort."
	.GSTR STR?258,"This is a closet for storage. The only exit is east."
	.GSTR STR?292,"This is a featureless tunnel, narrowing to the west. To the east is a deep gorge, probably too wide to jump across."
	.GSTR STR?267,"This is a flat and featureless dirt path leading north and south."
	.GSTR STR?309,"This is a huge tent filled with hectic noise, blinking lights, and the smell of frying food. Near the exit is a game booth lined with prizes. The concept of the game seems to be bashing cute little mechanical bunnies with a rubber ball as they hop around a little artificial meadow."
	.GSTR STR?280,"This is a large and well-equipped torture chamber. These were very popular in castles of several centuries ago, but are somewhat out of fashion now. There are exits to the west and north."
	.GSTR STR?316,"This is a large entrance hall, paved with polished stone. Large doorways lead north and south."
	.GSTR STR?246,"This is a large hall where the Guild's young apprentices live and study as they strive to achieve a seat on the Circle. You think back to the days when you occupied these quarters. The apprentices are gone, having accompanied Frobar into town to shop. You can leave to the southeast."
	.GSTR STR?312,"This is a large, plush room, slightly neglected."
	.GSTR STR?347,"This is a low, shadowy cave leading east to west. The rocky walls are scarred with deep claw marks."
	.GSTR STR?296,"This is a meandering north-south tunnel. A side passage leads to the southwest."
	.GSTR STR?270,"This is a moist room whose walls are thick with moss and lichens. A small hole leads up and a rocky passage leads south."
	.GSTR STR?340,"This is a narrow beach between a small cove to the east and tall cliffs to the west. The shore curves to the southeast and northeast. A metal chute leads up into the cliff."
	.GSTR STR?315,"This is a small underground hovel. On the far wall is a small fireplace, long unused."
	.GSTR STR?245,"This is a sparsely furnished living area for the servants of the Guild. None are in sight; presumably they are out doing their daily errands. You can leave to the southwest."
	.GSTR STR?291,"This is a strip of land to the east of a gaping chasm. You might try jumping across, but I'd advise against it. A wide crater lies to the east."
	.GSTR STR?254,"This is a study chamber for members of the Guild. Usually, there would be several elder Enchanters patiently training novices, but no one is here at the moment. The only exit is west.
Lying open on a stand in one corner is a heavy volume, probably a copy of the Encyclopedia Frobizzica."
	.GSTR STR?294,"This is a tall room flooded with light from an unseen source. The only exit is south."
	.GSTR STR?285,"This is a wide road winding away to the east and west, perhaps a relic of the Great Underground Empire you read about in history class. A passage leads up to the north."
	.GSTR STR?288,"This is an appliance store, apparently abandoned. The entrance lies to the north."
	.GSTR STR?328,"This is obviously the heart of a large coal mine, illuminated by a wall-mounted lamp. The bottom of a metal coal chute is visible at the north end of the room. Another chute continues downward at the southern end. A large coal bin is overflowing, and the floor is completely covered with lumps of coal. A passage leads east, but a western passage is blocked by rubble."
	.GSTR STR?282,"This is the dark and dank dungeon of the ruined castle. There's probably a torture chamber nearby. You can go east, northeast, or upward. A small opening leads down as well."
	.GSTR STR?250,"This is the entrance lobby of the Guild Hall. Befitting the status and wealth of the Guild, the lobby is finished with polished Antharian marble, inlaid with intricate patterns of silver leaf. To the north is a wide arch, and smaller openings flank the area on the eastern and western sides, as well as the northeastern and northwestern corners. A narrow stair leads downward. Through another arch to the south, you can see the entrance steps and the main road into town."
	.GSTR STR?343,"This is the floor of a cove off the turbulent ocean to the east. The ground slopes upward to the north, west, and south. Light filters down from the surface of the water."
	.GSTR STR?279,"This is the only turret of the castle still standing. It affords a marvelous view of a meadow to the west, and beyond that a twisted forest. To the north is a mighty fortress which stands atop a cliff where a turbulent river pours into an ocean. The ocean stretches out of sight to the east. A spiralling staircase leads downward."
	.GSTR STR?241,"This is the room of Frobar the Enchanter. There isn't much here in the way of furnishings, Frobar being a pretty dull kind of guy."
	.GSTR STR?353,"This is your chamber in the Hall of the Guild of Enchanters, with a doorway to the west. A private chamber is a great privilege, especially for an Enchanter as young as yourself, but how many Enchanters can say they defeated the infamous Krill?"
	.GSTR STR?305,"This looks like the entrance to a run-down amusement park, no longer gaudy with lights and glitter. A sign above the entrance proclaims ""Welcome to Bozbarland - The Entertainment Capital of the Empire."" The park lies to the west and a tunnel leads northeast."
	.GSTR STR?350,"This room is filled with blinding light that stabs at your eyes."
	.GSTR STR?337,"This small room has a slanted roof, presumably due to the coal chute which passes overhead. You can reenter the chute to the east."
	.GSTR STR?441,"This tea is cold! Get me another cup."
	.GSTR STR?301,"This was a barracks for the battalion stationed in this fort. You could leave to the south, or to the southeast."
	.GSTR STR?50,"This was not a safe place to try jumping. You should have looked before you leaped."
	.GSTR STR?419,"thrice"
	.GSTR STR?320,"Through a breathtaking archway of glass to the east is an area glistening with reflected light. Another exit leads south."
	.GSTR STR?91,"throw"
	.GSTR STR?265,"To the west, a path enters the blighted woods, which stretch out of sight. A signpost stands beside another path leading north, and to the east is a wide meadow. At the base of the signpost is a slimy hole leading down."
	.GSTR STR?184,"Too bad. Didn't quite make it."
	.GSTR STR?263,"transport caster to someone else's location"
	.GSTR STR?339,"travel temporally"

	.GSTR STR?151,"Uh, oh. They taste poisonous."
	.GSTR STR?402,"unable to keep your eyes open for more than a few moments at a time"
	.GSTR STR?271,"Undergrowth prevents travel along the bank."
	.GSTR STR?113,"Unfortunately, bats make poor swimmers. Glug, glug."
	.GSTR STR?168,"Unfortunately, this room of the maze has no floor."
	.GSTR STR?202,"Unfortunately, this section of the glass maze has no floor."
	.GSTR STR?79,"Unfortunately, you roll over in the middle of the night. Kaboom!!"

	.GSTR STR?102,"You appear in a strange room. Framed diplomas and wand racks adorn the walls, and a stuffed owl is perched above a trophy case. An incredibly old man with a long white beard spots you. ""Fertilize!"" he cries, pointing a slightly bent wand at you. You turn into a pile of bat guano, a fitting end for a trespasser."
	.GSTR STR?197,"You appear in an amusement park game booth. The point of the game is to pierce balloons with darts. Speaking of points, you are suddenly pierced by 37 flying darts."
	.GSTR STR?105,"You appear in the woods behind the Guild Hall. The servants (who should be doing their daily chores) are lazing about, drinking ale and betting on games of Gabber Tumper. To prevent you from reporting their goofing off, they cut your throat. You just can't get good help these days."
	.GSTR STR?17,"You appear on a road in a far-off province called Cambridge. As you begin choking on the polluted air, a mugger stabs you in the back with a knife. A moment later, a wild-eyed motorist plows over you."
	.GSTR STR?107,"You appear on the lawn of a large estate. A domesticated wolf, foaming saliva, is chasing the messenger across the lawn. With graceful agility, the messenger jumps aside, and the wolf sinks its rabid teeth into you instead."
	.GSTR STR?278,"You are amongst the ruins of an ancient castle. A winding stairway leads up to a crumbling turret, and a dark passage leads downward. A path heads through the rubble to the west."
	.GSTR STR?332,"You are at the bottom of an air shaft which looks climbable. A heavy door leads west."
	.GSTR STR?298,"You are at the center of a level field inside the fort. Entrances to rooms around the perimeter lie in several directions."
	.GSTR STR?307,"You are at the eastern end of a long midway. The park entrance lies to the east, and rides lie to the north and south."
	.GSTR STR?297,"You are at the entrance to Fort Griffspotter, which lies to the east. A trail leads along the river bank to the northwest."
	.GSTR STR?290,"You are at the northeastern rim of a gigantic crater, the result of some ancient explosion. A wide underground highway, which ends at the crater's edge, leads northeast."
	.GSTR STR?336,"You are at the western end of the coal mine. A metal chute leads downward."
	.GSTR STR?333,"You are deep inside a large coal mine, at the top of an air shaft. You could descend into the shaft; passages in many directions lead further into the mine."
	.GSTR STR?170,"You are immediately set upon by alligators and piranhas."
	.GSTR STR?335,"You are in a winding tunnel in a large coal mine. Passages lead off in many directions."
	.GSTR STR?261,"You are in the basement of the Guild Hall. A steep, narrow stair leads upward from the southwest corner."
	.GSTR STR?264,"You are on a path through a blighted forest. The trees are sickly, and there is no undergrowth at all. One tree here looks climbable. The path, which ends here, continues to the northeast."
	.GSTR STR?272,"You are on the bed of an evaporated river. Fish splash helplessly in tiny puddles. The bed leads northwest and southeast. A climb up the southwest bank is possible. To the northeast is a dark cave, hollowed out by years of rushing water."
	.GSTR STR?73,"You awake in the middle of the night to find a hellhound gnawing on you."
	.GSTR STR?77,"You awake to find snakes and beetles crawling all over you."
	.GSTR STR?436,"You can't be serious."
	.GSTR STR?323,"You couldn't even fly over these cliffs."
	.GSTR STR?386,"You dream of a river, slow and muddy. Great grey hippopotami sport there, bellowing and splashing, and twitching their ears."
	.GSTR STR?385,"You dream of dancing penguins in formal dress. One has a particularly nice tuxedo and a cane with a gold top.[ID: globals:1362]"
	.GSTR STR?456,"You feel a cold breath on your shoulder. You whirl around, but there is nothing there."
	.GSTR STR?460,"You feel a strange shiver in your chest, almost as though something had passed through your body."
	.GSTR STR?157,"You fly across the river's surface. Suddenly, a downdraft plunges you into the swirling rapids!"
	.GSTR STR?85,"You have a nightmare about a ferocious dorn beast. When it begins gnawing on you, you realize that it isn't a dream at all."
	.GSTR STR?269,"You have entered a shadowy pit full of nooks and crannies. From every direction you hear the hissing of vipers and the irregular clicking of giant beetles. Light spills down from above, and a small crack leads further downward into darkness."
	.GSTR STR?286,"You have reached a toll gate which spans the highway."
	.GSTR STR?100,"You materialize in a royal tomb somewhere. Before being devoured by rats, you notice a well-decayed corpse nearby."
	.GSTR STR?109,"You materialize in the middle of a powerful thaumaturgical experiment. A Guildmaster stands nearby, but before he can react you have turned into a large and rather ugly mushroom."
	.GSTR STR?466,"You miss the rabbit by a mile!"
	.GSTR STR?437,"You must have had a silliness spell cast upon you."
	.GSTR STR?24,"You pass out from lack of food and water."
	.GSTR STR?214,"You run out of air and drown."
	.GSTR STR?440,"You should never have let down your mindshield, you doddering old Enchanter."
	.GSTR STR?379,"You turn into a spot of moss"
	.GSTR STR?2,"You're not holding"
	.GSTR STR?217,"Your attack is somewhat quixotic as the vines wrap around and tear you to pieces."
	.GSTR STR?238,"Your bed occupies the far corner of the room."
	.GSTR STR?381,"Your entire body, starting from the toes and moving upward, turns into gelatin"
	.GSTR STR?75,"Your eyes are barely closed before the snake reaches you."
	.GSTR STR?380,"Your left ear turns into a carnivorous toad and devours your brain"
	.GSTR STR?1,"Your spell book begins to glow softly. "
	.GSTR STR?467,"Your throw is way off!"
