enormous statue of a demon which seems to reach towards you with
dripping fangs and razor-sharp talons. A low noise begins behind you,
and you turn to see hundreds of hunched and hairy shapes. A guttural
chant issues from their throats. Near you stands a figure draped in a
robe of deepest black, brandishing a huge sword. The chant grows louder
as the robed figure approaches the altar. The large figure spots you and
approaches menacingly. It reaches into its cloak and pulls out a great,
glowing dagger. It pulls you onto the altar and, with a murmur of
approval from the throng, slices you neatly across your abdomen.">)>>
