     important.

     old woman. Next time, make sure you're in the Magick Shoppe before five
     o'clock, and do what the old woman asks you to do!


Ye Olde Magick Shoppe
*********************

Why is "Magick" spelled with a "k"?
  A. Because.
  B. Oh, all right. "Magick" is an archaic spelling popularized by Aleister

     fantasies and tales of horror. It's supposed to imply an especially old
     and potent variety of supernatural force.

I found a bug! The clock on my status line stopped. Should I call Infocom?
  A. It's not a bug. See the previous question for details.
  B. If it was a bug, you could blame it on one of the Infopeople who tested
     the game. In alphabetical order, they are:
     "Hollywood" Dave Anderson (Manager), Joanne Avtges, Gary Brennan, Amy
     Briggs, Mark "Max" Buxton, Liz Cyr-Jones, Suzanne Frank, Jeff O'Neill,
     plus dozens of beta- and gamma-testers too numerous to list.

Who is "The Evil One"?

  O. Using the Darkness Wish to get past the troll is only useful if you
     have to go past him twice.
  P. If you've already released the snake, you'll have to use Magick.
  Q. The non-Magick way it [sic] to give the closed metal can to the troll,

  N. Then go to the hellhound and say ALEXIS, HEEL. The hellhound will
     become considerably less ferocious.


The Tower
*********

How do I get into the tower?
  A. Didn't King Anatinus say something about getting into the Tower?
  B. You need a Word of Power.
  C. The pelican knows what it is.
  D. The pelican won't give you the Word unless you give it something in
     return.
  E. GIVE THE WIZARD'S HAT TO THE PELICAN. A Word will be revealed to you.
     Go to the tower and say the word (just type it in). The drawbridge will
     lower automatically.

How did the Princess get captured again?
     She isn't a very smart platypus, is she?

Help! Mr. Crisp is getting ready to torture me!
  A. He's sleazy enough to take a bribe.
  B. Didn't somebody ask you to give him something a long time ago?
  C. GIVE THE VIOLET NOTE TO MR. CRISP.

Mr. Crisp is gone, but I'm still in chains! What should I do?
  A. There are two ways to get out of the chains.
  B. One of them involves Magick.
  C. WISH FOR FREEDOM will work.
  D. But you wouldn't need Magick if you had the key to the chains.
  E. Mr. Crisp dropped the key in his lab coat, remember?
  F. He dropped the lab coat on the floor.
  G. PICK UP THE WHITE LAB COAT. TAKE THE KEY OUT OF THE COAT. UNLOCK THE
     CHAINS WITH THE KEY.

Where did Mr. Crisp go?
  A. He went to visit his sweetheart, Miss Voss.
  B. But who cares, as long as he isn't here to torture you?

How do I free the Princess from the torture machine?
  A. Just do what she says.
  B. PULL DOWN THE LEVER.

How do I get out of the torture chamber?
  A. The same way Mr. Crisp did.
  B. OPEN THE HATCH. CLIMB UP THE LADDER.

What is the significance of the paintings in the Round Chamber?
  A. The story they illustrate may sound vaguely familiar.
  B. Especially if you read _The Legend of Wishbringer_.
  C. The paintings also conceal an important secret.
  D. LOOK BEHIND A PAINTING.

The drawbridge is closed! How do I get out of the Tower?
     Read the previous hint for clues.

The suit of armor is chasing me! What should I do?
  A. Hit it with the dead branch.
  B. Throw the stone at it.
  C. Light the grue's milk on fire with the candle, then give the milk to
     the suit of armor to drink. It'll still chase you, but at least it will
     be laughing.
  D. There is no suit of armor in this story.

Why is the room above the Round Chamber all blurry?
  A. Blurry, huh? Gee. Maybe you need glasses.
  B. PUT ON THE 3D GLASSES after you walk into the blurry room.

What should I do with the telescope in the Laboratory?
  A. You could ignore it. It's probably just a prop.
  B. The telescope is just a prop.
  C. So ignore it!

What is the significance of the bubbling chemicals?
     They're not significant at all. Leave them alone.

What is the purpose of the control panel?
  A. It has two switches, so it probably controls two things.
  B. Have you examined both of the switches?
  C. The first switch controls the power in the Palace Theater. (If you
     watched the entire movie, you'd already know this.)
  D. The second switch controls the "security" for something. Hmm. Wonder
     what the Evil One wants to keep secure...
  E. TURN OFF THE SECOND SWITCH.


The Library
***********

How do I get into the Library?
  A. Wait until Miss Voss opens it tomorrow morning.
  B. Unfortunately, you haven't got time to wait. Looks like you'll have to
     unlock the front door somehow.
  C. Miss Voss locked it earlier. Maybe she put the key somewhere.
  D. Have you visited Miss Voss's cottage yet?
  E. It's easy to get into the cottage once you tame the hellhound. (But
     that's another hint.)
  F. The key to the Library is on Miss Voss's bookcase.

How can I see in the Library? It's Dark.
  A. The candle is a source of light.
  B. Too bad the candle fizzles out when the Library door closes.
  C. Wishbringer is also a source of light.
  D. If you haven't found the Stone yet, you're in trouble. But there is
     another way to see in the Library.
  E. Have you examined the wizard's hat?
  F. Have you looked inside the wizard's hat?
  G. Have you dropped anything inside the wizard's hat?
  H. Things you drop into the wizard's hat disappear. But they might turn up
     someplace else.
  I. Things you drop into the hat appear in the Museum's display case.
  J. DROP THE CANDLE INTO THE WIZARD'S HAT before it gets blown out. You can
     later retrieve the candle for use as a source of light.

Where's the key to unlock the circulation desk?
  A. The steel key might work. After all, it unlocked the library door.
  B. Then again, why should a door key work in a desk?
  C. There is no desk key. You can't open the circulation desk.

How do I get the spider out of the Library books?
  A. You'll have to pick up the books first.
  B. You'll need a library card to take the books.
  C. Shucks! You forgot your library card.
  E. [sic] There isn't any spider in the library books.
  F. Or anywhere else, either.

How do I open the glass display case in the Museum?
  A. Did you try the rusty key?
  B. Did you try the steel key?
  C. Did you try the key in the circulation desk?
  D. Did you read the above hint about unlocking the circulation desk?
  E. You can't unlock the display case.
  F. Force may be necessary.
  G. You'll need a heavy object to break the case.
  H. Try BREAK THE DISPLAY CASE WITH THE HORSESHOE. You can also use the
     broom, the umbrella, the conch shell, the bottle or the dead branch.
  I. Naturally, you remembered to EXAMINE THE DISPLAY CASE before breaking
     it.
  J. You must deactivate the security system before breaking the case.
  K. The switch for the security system is in the Laboratory.

How do I get out of the library with the sculpture?
  A. Try unlocking the door.
  B. Lock's on the outside? Oh, well. Why not WISH FOR FLIGHT?
  C. Nope, you're indoors. But you can still WISH FOR FREEDOM.
  D. Not confined, eh? There must be another way out, then.
  E. Have you tried to EXAMINE THE SCULPTURE yet?
  F. Go on to the next hint.

What should I do with the sculpture?
  A. Such a fine work of art should probably be examined.
  B. Hmm. Seems to be a piece missing.
  C. Have you tried to WISH FOR ADVICE?
  D. Have you tried to WISH FOR FORESIGHT?
  E. Something might fit into the forehead of the statue.
  F. PUT THE STONE INTO THE FOREHEAD.

Who's the old woman in the Library?
  A. She looks familiar, but somewhat fuzzy.
  B. What can you do to make fuzzy things clearer?
  C. PUT ON THE 3D GLASSES.
  D. Yipes!

How do I escape from the sinister being?
  A. Just walk right past her. She won't mind.
  B. Much.
  C. You could try bribing her with something.
  D. Maybe she'll accept that nice, glowing stone you're holding.
  E. But if you want to finish the story, you won't give it to her.
  F. Stop fooling around! Kill her before she turns you into something
     awful!
  G. Too tough, eh? Maybe you should continue what you were doing before she
     interrupted.
  H. PUT THE STONE INTO THE FOREHEAD.
  I. Don't listen to her! PUT THE STONE INTO THE FOREHEAD!


The Seven Wishes
****************

What Advice can I get from the shell?
  A. There are seven bits of Advice. In order of appearance, they are:
  B. "If ye hath not kept a Map, only patience or Magick can help thee."
  C. "Magick may help thee cross the Bridge."
  D. "Release a Prisoner, and be Rewarded."
  E. "Learn the Word of Power, else never gain the Tower."
  F. "One path Magick, one path Science; both lead to thy Goal."
  G. "Many wonders await thee in the Halls of Knowledge."
  H. "Fit the Pieces together, and the Puzzle is complete."

Where is WISH FOR RAIN useful?
  A. If you're lost in the fog, wishing for Rain will wash you safely down
     to the Cliff Bottom.
  B. If you're at Edge of Lake, wishing for Rain will fill the narrow pit
     with water and free any creatures that may be trapped there.
  C. Wishing for Rain anywhere else is harmless, but the downpour might
     irritate nearby characters.

When should I WISH FOR FLIGHT?
  A. Whenever you want to go back to the Magick Shoppe. Just make sure
     you're outdoors (or in the Laboratory), and off you go!
  B. It's not a good idea to go back to the Magick Shoppe until you've found
     Chaos, the old woman's black cat.
  C. Make sure the black cat you've found is the right one.
  D. If you locate the real Chaos, you won't need to WISH FOR FLIGHT.
  E. So you'll never need to WISH FOR FLIGHT. It's a trap.

Why would I want to WISH FOR DARKNESS?
  A. Some characters might not like the sudden Darkness.
  B. One of them is the troll at the toll gate.
  C. If you WISH FOR DARKNESS with the troll present, he'll run away across
     the bridge.
  D. The gravedigger is afraid of the dark, too.
  E. If you WISH FOR DARKNESS in the Theater Lobby, you may be able to sneak
     past the terrified gravedigger into the theater. (Not a very good movie
     usher, is he?)
  F. There's one other creature who doesn't like Darkness.
  G. It's the hellhound.
  H. If you WISH FOR DARKNESS at Outside Cottage, the hellhound will cower
     in fear long enough for you to sneak past.

What happens when I WISH FOR FORESIGHT?
  A. You get a tantalizing, heavily symbolic glimpse of the future, all
     mixed up with snippets of the past and present.
  B. Don't worry about what it means.
  C. It's a dream sequence.

Why didn't the WISH FOR MAGICK work?
  A. You weren't holding Wishbringer.
  B. You weren't holding the Magick Wand.
  C. You didn't wave the Magick Wand over the Magick Rutabaga.
  D. Magick Wand? Magick Rutabaga? WISH FOR MAGICK?

Why should I WISH FOR LUCK?
  A. Luck gives you all sorts of little benefits that make it easier to
     finish the story.
  B. There are five ways the WISH FOR LUCK can help you.
  C. If you're Lucky, the troll won't notice that your gold coin is a
     "counterfeit."
  D. If you scare the troll away by wishing for Darkness, he'll drop your
     gold coin on the bridge...but only if you're Lucky.
  E. Normally, the eldritch vapors in the cemetary will carry you away and
     scatter all your possessions once they've taken a good look at you. But
     if you're Lucky, they'll steal your possessions, one at a time, before
     they carry you away.
  F. The hellhound will eat you up if you hang around for more than three
     moves. But if you're Lucky, it'll just keep roaring at you.
  G. Your chances of being eaten by a grue in the dark are much lower if
     you're Lucky.

I just neutralized my Luck Wish! What should I do?
     Next time, avoid opening the umbrella indoors or walking under the
     ladder. These are very Unlucky things to do.

Where should I WISH FO FREEDOM?
  A. It only works in two situations.
  B. If you're thrown in jail more than once, the only way out is to WISH
     FOR FREEDOM. You'll usually end up on Lookout Hill (unless the Boot
     Patrol is there, in which case the Stone will thoughtfully deposit you
     outside the Police Station).
  C. You can also free yourself from the chains in the Torture Chamber with
     a WISH FOR FREEDOM.
  D. Just make sure Mr. Crisp isn't there when you try it.
