"Mr. Robner's work was his life, as pointed out by a number of the principals.
George knew that his father had lost control of the company, and a story in
the newspaper indicated that Baxter intended to sell the company to a
multi-national conglomerate, presumably to advance his career. Baxter admitted
to the merger plans, but indicated that Mr. Robner was in complete agreement.
This is contrary to what George and Mrs. Robner said. The note pad found in
the library was Robner's last, desperate attempt to save the company, in which
Robner threatened to expose Baxter's involvement in the Focus scandal. Baxter
denied getting the note, but it was not in the trash. The papers detailing
Baxter's criminality in the scandal were kept locked in a safe in a hidden
closet near the library. Only George and Marshall Robner knew the whereabouts
of the safe.|
  Baxter planned to murder his partner, aided by the fact that Robner was
known to be depressed, even suicidal. He enlisted the help of his lover,
Dunbar, one of whose medicines was found to interact fatally with the pills
Robner was taking. The relationship of Baxter and Dunbar was kept quiet,
although Mrs. Rourke had an inkling of it. After the concert in Hartford which
both Baxter and Dunbar attended, they returned to the Robner estate. Dunbar
placed some LoBlo in Robner's tea. After Robner died, Baxter used the ladder
from the shed to enter the library and exchange the incriminating cup for a
clean one (counting the china in the kitchen reveals that a cup is missing).
Coming down the ladder, Baxter presumably dropped the cup and inadvertently
left one piece on the ground in the rose garden, near the ladder holes that
McNabb found while tending his roses.|
