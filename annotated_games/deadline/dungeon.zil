   I am sorry to learn that Marshall has been despondent again. His
obsessive interest in business must be causing you terrible anguish. It
doesn't surprise me that he talks of suicide when he's in this state,
but the thought of the business going to Baxter after he's gone will keep
him alive.|
   So George has finally gone too far? It's hard to believe, after all those
empty threats, that Marshall actually followed through. It serves that little
leech right, if you ask me. This means that, should the unthinkable happen,
you will be provided for as you deserve.|
   I'll see you Friday as usual.||

"Dear Inspector,|
|
    In response to your request for analysis of the ceramic fragment, we have
found evidence of a drug called Methsparin, which is usually sold in this
country under the name \"LoBlo\". It is a blood pressure lowering agent used
primarily in Europe, which explains the oversight in our blood analysis of the
deceased. A double check reveals a high blood level of Methsparin. While the
amount of Methsparin in the blood isn't dangerous in itself, a strong reaction
between it and various other drugs has been well documented. As you may have
gathered, one of those drugs is Amitraxin (Ebullion). The effect of Methsparin
is to displace Amitraxin from protein binding, leaving more free in the blood
and simulating an overdose.|
    Your new evidence leads me to conclude that the cause of death was
Amitraxin toxicity secondary to ingestion of Methsparin and Amitraxin in
combination.[RWD_ID: dungeon:1861, VAL: 1]|

Sincerely,|

Arthur Chatworth, Pathologist|
