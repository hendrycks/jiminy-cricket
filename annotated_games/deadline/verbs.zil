;"V-WAIT has three modes, depending on the arguments:
1) If only one argument is given, it will wait for that mnay moves
2) If a second argument is given, it will wait the least of the first
   argument number of moves and the time at which the second argument
   (an object) is in the room with the player.
3) If the third argument is given, the second should be FALSE.  It will
   wait <first argument> number of moves (or at least try to...).  The
   third argument means that an 'internal wait' is happening (e.g. for
   a 'careful' search)."
