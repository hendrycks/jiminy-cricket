The Basics
**********

Some advice:
  A. Like all good detectives throughout history, you will have to do a lot
     of legwork. You should check out the house and all of the grounds,
     examine everything, analyze everything, check for fingerprints, etc.;
     you must be diligent. If you suspect Ebullion in the sugar, have it
     analyzed for Ebullion. In general, it is a good idea to ask each of the
     characters about all of the others. Sometimes by comparing stories you
     can learn something. Keep an organized record of the results of your
     investigation.
  B. Read very carefully the Inspector's Casebook that came with the game.
     Also be sure to read and refer to the Coroner's examination, the letter
     from Coates, and the police interviews with those who knew the deceased
     well.
  C. If you find out anything that may contradict what someone has said or
     that might be of interest to them, ask them about it, show it to them,
     or confront them with it.
  D. If anyone acts suspiciously, follow them. Watch what they do.
  E. Much of what you need to learn will come out only if you keep after the
     suspects in a "Columbo-like" way (in other words, putting pressure on
     them until they react).

Communicating with DEADLINE:
     Some people find it frustrating when their words or sentence structures
     are not understood. The Infocom series of games is considered to have
     the best language-handling ability of any programs available for
     microcomputers. DEADLINE is among the best of this elite group.
     However, probably due to its real-life setting, some players expect
     more understanding. A careful reading of the Instructor's [sic]
     Casebook, especially "Dealing with Suspects" and "Commonly Encountered
     Terms," should be very helpful. Once you get the hang of it, the
     limitations will be less frustrating.

Hidden Questions
****************

Develop the numbered questions only when you are directed to in other parts
of this booklet.

1.   When should I listen to Leslie's phone call?

  E. The last line looks like "Reconsider before it is too late!"
  F. Have you asked the other characters about the merger and Focus?
  G. You might want to show certain people the note also.

  F. Now that you have seen someone enter the hidden closet, you can
     discover the way to get in -- examine the bookshelves. (Alternatively,
     you could have found the way in without seeing George enter if you did
     a careful examination at some time after George has entered and left
     the button uncovered by the books.)

6.   How do I open the safe?

     +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

11.  What do I need to get a conviction?
     You need a good case. There must be a clear motive, means of
     administering the drug and removing the evidence, no alibi, and no
     inconsistencies.

12.  How can I prove that Mr. Baxter was involved?
  A. You'll have to come up with a motive. Develop Hidden Question 19.
  B. He has a good alibi for the night of the crime. You'll have to destroy
     it. Develop Hidden Question 20.
  C. You must also prove he had the means to carry out the crime. Develop
     Hidden Question 21.

13.  How can I prove George is guilty?
  A. You'll need a solid motive.
  B. "Love of money is the root of all evil."
  C. A threatened change in the will would be a good reason...
  D. Have you shown him the desk-calendar entry concerning the new will?
  E. You'll also have to prove that he had the means to carry out the crime.
     Develop Hidden Question 22.

14.  How do I prove that Mrs. Robner is guilty?
  A. She certainly had a motive -- Steven.
  B. She also had a convenient balcony to reenter the house without Mrs.
     Rourke hearing her.
  C. Was there any mud on her balcony or in her room?
  D. How would she have gotten the LoBlo into Mr. Robner's tea?
  E. She couldn't do it alone.

15.  How do I convict Ms. Dunbar?
  A. What would her motive be?
  B. She certainly had the opportunity to put her LoBlo in the tea.
  C. How did he reenter the house without Mrs. Rourke hearing her?
  D. She could not have done it alone. You'll have to find a reason she
     might help someone else.

16.  What was McNabb's motive?
  A. Is it possible that Mr. Robner stepped on a rosebush?
  B. Be serious. McNabb is certainly not a suspect.

17.  How did Steven get the LoBlo capsules?
  A. This is a red herring.
  B.            >>This space intentionally left blank.<<
  C.            >>This space intentionally left blank.<<


18.  What caused the bruise on Mr. Robner's left temple?
  A. It is interesting that it was the left temple, since the body was lying
     on the right side on the floor.
  B. It is possible that Mr. Robner hit his head on the desk as he fell.
  C. It is also possible that the body was moved for some reason.
  D. There is no evidence that will allow a definite answer to this. It will
     remain a mystery forever.

19.  How do I prove a motive for Mr. Baxter?
  A. There is an item of interest in the library.
  B. Check out the notepad.
  C. It appears that Baxter was involved in something called Focus. You will
     need to find the documents referred to in the note.

20.  How can Baxter's alibi be destroyed?
  A. In his police interview, he said he was at the concert alone.
  B. Before continuing, show Ms. Dunbar the lab report and follow up on the
     subsequent developments.
  C. Develop Hidden Questions 28 and 29.

21.  How did Baxter carry out the murder?
  A. How could he have gotten the LoBlo into Mr. Robner's tea?
  B. He had to have an accomplice.
  C. Ms. Dunbar delivered the tea and is obviously romantically involved
     with Baxter.

22.  How did George carry out the murder?
  A. How did he get the LoBlo into the tea?
  B. How did he reenter the house without Mrs. Rourke hearing him (or is she
     lying)?

23.  Why is this question here?
  A. If you thought there were no more questions,
  B. you might be able to deduce
  C. something you should not yet know.
  D. This way,
  E. before you have developed every hint,
  F. the fact that this question remained undeveloped
  G. implied that one of the remaining hints was very important.
  H. But obviously it wasn't.

24.  What do I do with the fragment?
  A. Did you clean it off and examine it?
  B. Do you recall anything similar?
  C. Didn't you examine the teacup in the library or those in the kitchen?
  D. If you count the teacups and saucers in the kitchen, you'll notice a
     teacup is missing.
  E. Could the teacup in the library be a substitute?
  F. The fragment ought to be analyzed.
  G. What might the chemical that "is not a common medication" be?
  H. One of the bottles of medicine was from another country.
  I. Have the fragment analyzed for the medication you suspect.
  J. Say ANALYZE THE FRAGMENT FOR LOBLO.

25.  What does the shoe size and depth indicate?
     See the answer to Hidden Question 26.

26.  Who put the stolen Rembrandt in the attic?
     See the answer to Hidden Question 25.

27.  Why is there both a living and a dead Ms. Dunbar?
  A. Do you remember Dunbar referring to her identical twin sister?
  B. Wasn't Mrs. Robner an expert in makeup and impersonations during her
     early theatrical career?
  C. Wasn't Clement a plastic surgeon?
  D. This was a very funny bug in the early releases (revisions) of the
     game.

28.  Is the ticket stub meaningful?
  A. If you show Baxter the ticket stub, he admits that he was at the
     concert with Ms. Dunbar, but says that she became ill at intermission
     and took a cab home.
  B. Dunbar originally said she was "out with a friend and we didn't get
     back until 10:30."
  C. If you confront Dunbar with the ticket stub (and she wasn't present
     when you showed it to Mr. Baxter), she says "... we go to concerts,
     only occasionally, you understand. We went that night, the night that
     Marshall died. And then he took me home and that's it."
  D. So, Baxter was at the Robner home Wednesday night but lied about it.

29.  Where is the ticket stub?
  A. Ms. Dunbar has it.
  B. Searching won't turn it up.
  C. Follow her after showing her the lab report. When she sees you, you
     will make her so nervous that she will drop the stub.


Possible Endings
****************

Do not look at these until you have finished the game.
  A. Of course, killing yourself ends the game. Sometimes, if you try to
     kill another character or attack them in certain other ways, the game
     will end (often somewhat humorously).
  B. Arresting someone before you have proof that it was a murder results in
     a refusal by the district attorney to seek an indictment. If it is
     Baxter whom you arrest, there are two variations on this -- depending
     on whether you have seen the papers on the Focus scandal. In all these
     scenarios, you are chastised by your superior for not being more
     careful.
  C. If you arrest George after seeing the new will or after seeing him in
     the process of destroying it, the jury acquits him. They evidently feel
     that destroying the will is insufficient evidence for a guilty verdict.
  D. If you arrest Mrs. Robner after opening her mail or listening in on her
     call to Steven, the grand jury declines to indict "citing, among other
     things, a lack of evidence linking her with the execution of the
     crime."
  E. If Baxter is arrested after you have seen the lab report confirming
     that Mr. Robner was murdered, the jury acquits him. They cite the lack
     of a motive or the means to administer the drug. He is also acquitted
     if arrested after you have proof of murder and the documents
     implicating him in the Focus scandal. The jury feels the lack of means
     of administering the drug without a struggle is a serious flaw.
  F. If you arrest George and Baxter, the district attorney throws out your
     case, noting that the only link between the two was hatred. If you
     arrest them after seeing the new will (or seeing George trying to
     destroy it), seeing the notepad note, and seeing the papers on the
     Focus scandal, the D.A. spends much more time interrogating them.
     Although he realizes they had motives, he decides not to indict them
     since "no coherent and consistent theory could be proposed which
     involved the two of them conspiring to murder Mr. Robner."
  G. Arresting Mr. Baxter after Ms. Dunbar's death can lead to a number of
     different endings. If you saw the suicide note, pen, or saw Mr. Baxter
     leaving the scene of the shooting but have not yet established a motive
     for Baxter to kill Robner, Baxter is found guilty only of the death of
     Ms. Dunbar. If you have established a motive (seen the Focus papers and
     read the note), Baxter is found guilty of both murders. If you have no
     evidence that Baxter murdered Dunbar, there are two possible endings,
     depending on whether you have proved a motive for Baxter to have killed
     Robner. In each of these endings, the jury acquits Baxter, believing
     that Dunbar murdered Mr. Robner and then committed suicide.
  H. If you surprise Mr. Baxter on his way to kill Ms. Dunbar, the game ends
     in your death.
  I. If you arrest Ms. Dunbar after witnessing her meeting with Baxter after
     you have confronted her with the lab report, she is later found dead of
     an apparent suicide while out on bail during her trial.
  J. There are several possible endings if you arrest both Ms. Dunbar and
     Mr. Baxter. If you have no evidence of murder, the D.A. refuses to seek
     an indictment. If you haven't proved a motive with the Focus scandal
     papers, the grand jury refuses to indict them. If you have the Focus
     papers but haven't seen the note, Baxter and Dunbar are tried -- and
     several jurors believe them to be guilty -- but they are not convicted
     since there is nothing relating the old Focus scandal to the murder. If
     you have proof of murder, the note, and the Focus papers, you must
     still disprove Baxter's alibi for the night of the murder (most of the
     jurors will vote to convict, but a couple of them will feel there is
     reasonable doubt). Only if you have gotten conflicting stories from
     Baxter and Dunbar about the night of the murder by confronting them
     with the ticket stub while the other is not in the room to hear the
     story, can you convict the two of them.


For Your Amusement
******************
(after you've finished the game)

Have you ever tried:
