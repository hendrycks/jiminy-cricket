"This code is the local T system.  There are four transit lines:
  TOP-OF-THE-LINE, BOTTOM-LINE, FOOD-LINE, and OUTSIDE-LINE,
  corresponding to upstairs, downstairs, kitchen area, and outside.
  There are routes for each of these lines and transfer points.  Much of
  this is done for the  general case, except transfers.  Sigh."
