I think I am onto something big. Really big. This is the chance I’ve been
waiting for, the chance to prove to everyone that I’m not just someone’s errand
boy.
After the way Craige treated me on that ridiculous safari I developed a
distaste for him. Everyone jumped when he spoke  the great white hunter, puffed
up and dressed the part. I knew everything he knew about running a safari and
he still treated me like dirt. Even his client, Joshua Rankin, thought Craige was
someone really special, someone who had seen everything, been everywhere, was
always in control of every situation.
The way he always barked orders got to me after a while. "Help the bearers
strike the tents," he’d say, or, "Check the supplies." God, how I learned to despise
him.
I played it smart, though. I knew better than to
confront him, to let him know I saw right through him. I
bided my time, waited until we were back in the States,
then formulated a simple plan. It was risky, and I had no
idea what Craige would do if he caught me at it, but I was
just as good to him, and all I
needed was the break to prove it.
Well that break came this morning, when a Miss
Ellingsworth called. Craige was out of the office, so I
answered the phone. I told a little lie when I told her
who I was. She wanted someone with a lot of
experience to find something out in the desert, and I
told her I was Craige’s partner, and I had all the
experience for the job. When she asked for Craige, who
was out checking on some new equipment, I told her
he was on safari and it was me or no one.
She bit! She gave me her address and I went over
to talk to her. She was grey-haired spinster type, about
65 or so, living in an old pretty run-down place.
This is the story she told me:
Her father was an archaeologist in the early part
of the century. Somehow he got his hands on an
ancient artifact, a pottery shard more than 5000 years
old inscribed with strange hieroglyphs. From what he
deciphered, the shard pointed to the general location
of a pyramid, a pyramid which no one had ever heard
of before. He kept as quiet about his discovery as
possible and, after your years of bowing, scraping, and
petitioning foundations and universities, managed to
fund a small expedition in 1920. He took his wife and
a newborn daughter along for the trip. After a few
months of disheartening searching, he came across something which proved he
was on the right track  a small block of limestone inscribed with those same odd
hieroglyphs. When he decoded it he discovered it referred to vast riches and a
queen.
That’s as far as he got, though. The desert heat and the local water got to
him and he died there. His widow and child returned to the States and, when
Tut’s tomb was discovered a few years later, Miss Ellingsworth’s mother figured
they’d dug up her dead husband’s pyramid. She stowed all his records and
belongings in a steamer chest and forgot about the whole thing.
And there it rested for sixty years until the
mother died. Miss Ellingsworth went through the
stuff in the attic and found the limestone cube, a
map, a partial hieroglyphic dictionary, and a
rubbing of the cube. From what she could tell, the
pyramid was nowhere near Tut’s, so she called
Craige to see what could be done.
"Just think of the historical significance of
such a discovery," Miss Ellingsworth said to me,
handing over her father’s things. Sure, it was a
cinch. I looked the pieces over. With the map, the
task seemed easy. I could practically see the
pyramid in my mind. All the glory would be mine
 not Craige’s! This was a chance to show the
world what a fool Craige was, a chance to prove
that I was better than him. There would be
enough gold and treasures in the pyramid to set
me up for life but, more importantly, it would
give me the reputation I deserved but had been
denied by the glory-grabbing Craige.
I’ve been preparing for something like this to come along. I’ve saved money,
sold the condo and just about everything I had that was worth anything, waiting
patiently for the right opportunity. Now it’s here and I realize I am undercapitalized.
Miss Ellingsworth has no money  all she
really wants out of this is to make her Dad into
someone famous  so it’s all up to me.
I packed my bags and got my visa today.
Tomorrow I take off for Egypt. I won’t bother giving
Craige notice.
July 13
We leave for the pyramid site tomorrow at daybreak. I am in
El Menhir, a muddy little village on the Nile. I’ve managed to keep
my purpose here a secret  I told the locals I was a scientist,
interested in making sonar soundings in the desert. But I did
confide in Abdul, the top guide in the area. He’ll be the go between
for me and the locals he lined up to do the work. He also rounded
up all the supplies we need  tents, K-rations, cooking utensils, and
the like.
July 22
It’s been one disaster after another, but none of it is really my fault! First,
we hardly get into the real desert area when the navigator box falls off the back
of the jeep. Great! I had to radio back to Cairo for a replacement and they said
they’d get it to me, air-drop it into the encampment, in a few days - another
expense in an already tight expedition $!$!$!
Then the dates Abdul bought turned
out to be insect infested and spoiled. The
locals started grumbling and muttering,
and one of them had the nerve to demand
more money. I promised everyone a big
bonus if all went well. They looked at me as if
I were lying. I don’t think they trust me, and
I don’t know how much longer I can keep
them digging, and still stay in control. I
don’t remember Craige ever having these
problems. And this kind of thing sure never
happened to the heroes in "True Tales of
Adventure."
August 6
We’ve been at the site for three weeks now and the new navigation box still
hasn’t arrived. I figured it would be the best to keep the men busy - "idle hands"
and all that - digging in the general area indicated on the map. Without that
box, though, it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack.
Worse, the crew suspects I am trying to pull a fast one on them. Abdul came
to me and said I had better do something or there’d be trouble. I laughed at
Abdul, telling him that I was in control, that nothing is going to happen that I
didn’t want to happen. Abdul said "What about the box? Did you want it to
break?" I guess I got a little too angry when he said that. I slapped him across the
face! Abdul said nothing, but he glared at me. I think I might have handled him
better.
August 8
THE BOX STILL ISN’T HERE! Without it, I don’t think I’ll be able to hold
things together much longer. Our food stores are pretty low. The men are
grumbling more and more. They stop working unless I stand over them and
watch. One of them simply refuse to work at all, and Abdul is no real help. He
seems to take their side.
August 12
No box!! Radioed Cairo yesterday and the
day before. They assure me it’s on the way. If it is,
where is it?
Abdul led the men into the desert to
perform some religious ceremony, but I didn’t
believe it was holyday. All I could think of was
that the whole thing was getting out of control.
That I was losing the only real chance I ever
had. That if I didn’t get them back to digging it
would be all over. I marched out into the desert
to confront Abdul. I asked him to stop this
foolishness and get back to work. Abdul looked
very offended! I pushed him, demanding to
order the men to work. He didn’t push me back,
but he did say, "You will regret that, you
sacrilegious dog!"
Terrific! Looks like I blew it! How was I to know it really was a holy day?
They moved off further into the desert to conduct their ceremony out of my sight.
A little later, while I was lying on my cot,
trying to figure out what to say to them that
wouldn’t sound too much like an apology,
one of the men came into my tent. He seemed
real friendly, and asked for the calfskin of
Kumiss. I figured they’d gotten over my little
flareup and all was forgiven. He brought the
calfskin back a few minutes ago. I am going
to write to Miss Ellingsworth back in the
States to assure her everything’s going okay.
One thing I don’t need is for her to hire
someone else for this job, especially after what
I’ve been through. A few swigs of Kumiss
should get me through the letter OK.

August 12
Dear Rose,
Here we are at the site, the same site that your father’s expedition occupied
almost 65 years ago, and things could hardly be any better. The weather is about
average for a season - it’d be around 105º in the shade, if there were any shade -
and aside from the occasional sandstorms, our camp has remained a merry one.
Abdul and the boys are having a wonderful time, and we are all hitting it off just
fine.
I guess it’s true what they say about us all being brothers under the skin.
Notwithstanding the archaeological importance of the find and the profits it
may accrue, the greatest treasure I’ll bring back from this journey is the wealth of
understanding I’ve gained through our brisk cultural exchange of customs and
ideas. The other night, for instance, I treated the fellows to their first omelettes,
and you should have heard the exclamations with which they greeted this new
culinary experience. For my part, I am rapidly acquiring a taste for kumiss, a
refreshing native beverage made from fermented camel’s milk. At first the flavor
seemed strange to my western palate, but of late I’ve grown exceedingly familiar
with it. In fact, I am enjoying a stoup of kumiss right now. I shall be sure to bring
you a bottle or two of this zesty concoction upon my return.
Of course everything can’t be perfect. We’ve had a slight delay while we wait
for the new navigation box to arrive. (I may have forgotten to mention in my
previous letter that the old box became damaged just as we were setting out.)
Nevertheless, such is the spirit of camaraderie and good fellowship here in camp
that the boys voluntarily continued digging on the off chance that we might
locate the pyramid without the aid of scientific instrumentation. This
steadfastness in the face of adversity is truly heartwarming, and I’ve rewarded
the crew by giving them today off.
This has given me a chance to get off myself and relax. The strain of
command must be telling on me - just now, as I was sipping some kumiss, I began
to feel lightheaded, and my knees buckled slightly. Or perhaps I’m just
intoxicated with the awe-inspiring vastness of this solitude that surrounds me. In
any case, I shall have to lay this letter aside for the time being, until this
numbness leaves my hands and the landscape stops writhing around so
violently... Hello I hat have been staring at the same grain of sand for last hour
and have you ever heard it said that if yow move one grain of sand you change
the course of history? well here goes nothing - There, I done it, hope I’ve made the
world a better place to live in..... My, my doesn’t don’t I feel strange tonight I
wonder what’s come over me but wait!!!! there was something very important I
meant to tell you about this waistland Oh yes now I remember Did you ever stop
to think that T.S.Eliot’s name is an anagram for "toilets"? I think I now
understand what he was trying to tell us all, Rosetta --------------- must be the
desertsuns played mischiff with my eyes for now as i gaze across the moonlit dunes
who are in no way related to lorna dune i see theyve turned into crashing
curling waves in an endless sea to shining sea how they cast strange
shadowshapes of wild arabian demons [drawing of head with very evil look and a turban 
from which devil's horns rise] who are coming for me with my final summons in the
kitchen with dinahso possibly its the kumiss that’s causing these tiny little spots to
dance and swirl before my eyes like granes of sand through an hourglass so are
the daze of our life savings blown on a hopeless expidision thats gonna get yors
trully killed just so i can watch these spots as they grow and grow and get furrier
an furrier.. * until theyve changed into gnarled blue men about two foot tall

their shinnyshinshins as the three little pigs used to say in Piglatin eeway eeway
