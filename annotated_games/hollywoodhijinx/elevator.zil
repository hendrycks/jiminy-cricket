\"I'm sorry I put you through all this, Pumpkin, but your Uncle Buddy and
I had to be sure that whoever inherited the estate and the studio would
be clever enough to handle it all. The only way I could be sure the
stipulations in my will would be carried out would be to oversee it
myself, so I faked my death,\" says Aunt Hildegarde, hugging you so
tight she squeezes the air out of your lungs. \"Tomorrow we'll go see my
lawyer and he'll take care of all the paper work. I know you'll take
good care of Hildebud and the studio. As for me, I'm sure it won't be
long before the press discovers I'm alive. I plan to go to the south of
France for a rest while the story leaks out. It will be great publicity
for the studio,\" says Aunt Hildegarde. Then she adds, \"And let's hope
we've seen the last of your Cousin Herman.\"" CR><PRINT-ID "elevator:1181">
