" quickly realize why \"A Corpse Line\" could never be released: From
the back of a large theatre the camera slowly pans in. The camera
moves forward and you are able to make out a dozen or more figures lying
side-by-side on the stage in glittering top hats. Then the music starts
and the figures rise to their feet. The camera is now close enough to
see more detail. The figures are corpses, some badly decayed, clad in
top hats. They begin to dance in unison as the music swells. For a
moment you forget they are corpses and begin to enjoy their mastery of
the art.~
~
Then the horror begins, just as it must have for Uncle Buddy. The line
does a kick, and several legs fly into the audience. You feel your heart
pounding as never before. The corpses, gripping each other's shoulders,
turn at the same time and a half-dozen arms are pulled from their
sockets. You can't seem to catch your breath. It's as if a pile of
bricks were stacked on your chest. As the number ends, the corpses
(what's left of them) remove their hats to take a bow. The camera moves
in close as they bend over and you see the tops of their heads have been
removed. You begin to shake uncontrollably, then you feel what seems
like an explosion in your chest. The last thing you see is the corpses'
brains plop onto the stage as they take their bow. You collapse.">>

has it that as he was dying he proclaimed \"A Corpse Line\" to be his
