;"poster text: Melts in your mouth-- Scientists discover that people who
crave chocolate can actually get more pleasure from human flesh, but the
acne is much worse. Soon the word leaks out and one brave chocaholic
takes a bite out of her brother. The next ninety minutes are a frenzy of
munching while scientist and candy makers race to find a cure.
Morticians, sensing they are sitting on a gold mine, begin to market
bizzare products like                . Soon the forces of good rally,
with the aid of chainmail armor, rounding up the mis-guided flesh eaters
along with anyone with a bad complexion."
