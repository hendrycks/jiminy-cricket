Sample Question
***************

Why is the bureaucrat crying?
  - Did you notice what the bureaucrat was holding?
  - He has only an inkpad.
  - Maybe if you found him a rubber stamp, he would stop blubbering and help
    you.

Around the Grounds
******************

How do I get inside the house?
  - As the game begins, try walking east or west, then returning to the
    south junction (by going south).
  - Hmmm. The statue's facing a different direction. Peculiar, eh?
  - You can turn the statue so that the bazooka points in any compass
    direction.
  - Just like the dial on some kind of wacky combination lock.
  - If you could find the right combination of directions to turn the statue
    in, you could unlock the front door.
  - Did you find any compass directions mentioned in any of the materials in
    your game package?
  - Look closely at the poem on the back of Uncle Buddy's photo.
  - The poem prominently mentions three directions within various movie
    titles.
  - If you turn the statue in these directions, in order, the front door
    will unlock with a click.

Is there anything I should do with the statue of Buck Palace, the fighting
letter carrier?
  - Yes, Buck is very important.
  - Have you noticed you can turn Buck to point in different directions?
  - Buck will help you get in the house. See the previous question if you
    need more help.

I can't get past the water buffalo in Charo's kitchen. What should I do?
  - Drink all the water in any pond.
  - Squeeze your nose with a garlic mincer.
  - Swallow your hands.
  - Go rollerskating in a nearby subway tunnel.
  - Only develop the answers to questions on which you're really stumped.

What should I do in the hedge maze?
  - As you may have guessed, you'll need to get to a secret location within
    the maze.
  - The location of this spot is well-marked on a map of the maze.
  - Have you found a piece of paper with lines on it?
  - If so, then you have a partial map of the maze. It shows the positions
    of half of the hedge walls.
  - The X on the piece of paper shows where your destination in the hedge
    maze is located.
  - By itself, the piece of paper is enough to go on; you can fill in the
    other positions of the hedge walls by trial and error. This will require
    a considerable amount of patience and map-making, though.
  - If you'd like to save time and effort, you'll find a second piece of
    paper later in the story. It shows the locations of the other hedge
    walls.
  - If you PUT THE YELLOWED PIECE ON THE THIN PIECE, you'll be able to view
    the whole hedge maze map.

Hey, the secret location in the maze isn't any different from the other
spots in the maze! What gives?
  - The location is cosmetically the same as any other in the maze...
  - ...but looks aren't everything.
  - What would a pirate do at the X on a treasure map? (No, I don't mean a
    software pirate!)
  - Did you bring a shovel into the maze?
  - If so, typing DIG IN GROUND should uncover something different.

How do I open the small compartment under the cannon?
  - You'll have to move the cannon off of the compartment's lid first.
  - Like most cannons, however, this one is much too heavy for a person to
    move.
  - If you fired the cannon, the recoil might push it back a few feet.
  - Especially if there was something heavy in the barrel.
  - How about the cannon ball?
  - TAKE THE CANNON BALL. PUT IT IN THE CANNON. LIGHT THE FUSE with any
    source of fire. When the cannon fires, it will recoil, and move off of
    the small compartment.

Where can I find a source of fire?
  - There's a match inside the mansion.

How do I open the hatch at the cliff?
  - You can't open it from above. You'll find a way to open it from below
    later on in the story.

Is there a way to get the ladder up the cliff face?
  - It's a pretty heavy ladder.
  - And such a steep cliff!
  - In short, no.

How do I get across the gap in the beach stairs?
  - If you haven't figured out how to get into the mansion, you won't be
    able to cross the gap. Go on to something else for now.
  - If you've gotten into the house and explored a little of the first
    floor, then this puzzle should be a downhill struggle.
  - Snow what I mean?
  - The skis will help you across the gap.
  - Take the skis to the top landing and put them on. Then, just SKI DOWN
    THE STAIRS. They'll carry you across the gap.


First Floor
***********

What should I do with the fireplace?
  - If you haven't already done so, you may want to ENTER THE FIREPLACE.
  - Have you tried removing the loose brick?
  - Good foothold, huh?
  - Still stumped? Type UP.

Is there any significance to the painting of Uncle Buddy and Aunt
Hildegarde?
  - Yes.
  - It's rather moving, isn't it?
  - You can look behind it.

Oh! I found a wall safe! How do I open it?
  - You'll have to find the right combination.
  - The solution isn't exactly black and white.
  - It's actually red, white and blue.
  - Try examining the three wax statuettes.
  - Each is holding up a certain number of fingers on a certain hand.
  - TURN THE DIAL RIGHT TO 3. TURN IT LEFT TO 7. TURN IT RIGHT TO 5. OPEN
    THE SAFE.

What do I do in the closet?
  - Have you tried doing anything with the coat pegs?
  - Try typing PULL THE THIRD PEG.
  - You're on the second floor now. The closet is really an elevator! (By
    similar logic, pulling the first peg will bring the closet to the cellar
    level, and pulling the second will take you back to the first floor.)

Is there anything I can do with the sawed-off peg in the closet?
  - If you don't understand how the closet works, don't go on. Develop the
    clues in the question above this one.
  - You can't actually do anything with the sawed-off peg.
  - It's just a clue.
  - It tells you that there must be another floor above the second story.

Can I do anything with the hole to the left of the first peg?
  - If you don't understand how the closet works, don't go on. Develop the
    clues in the "What do I do in the closet?" question.
  - Since there was once a peg in this hole, there must be a floor below the
    cellar.
  - There is a peg that will fit into this hole...
  - ...but don't waste valuable time looking for it. When the time is right,
    you'll find the peg.

What's the point of the model of downtown Tokyo?
  - EXAMINE THE MODEL.
  - This is a puzzle. To solve it you will need to obtain the Big Diamond
    Ring, which you'll find perched on the monument in the tiny park.
  - Since the model's encased in a thick plastic dome, you'll need to
    manipulate the Atomic Chihuahua using the five colored buttons in order
    to get the ring.

What is an Atomic Chihuahua?
  - It's a chihuahua which has received an extreme amount of radiation (and
    isn't too happy about it either).
  - It's also the subject of one of your Uncle Buddy's more mundane motion
    pictures.

How can destroy the tanks?
  - A pressing problem, huh?
  - Figure out what each of the colored buttons does.
  - Since the black button causes the Chihuahua to stomp, it seems your best
    bet.
  - PRESS THE BLACK BUTTON when one of the tanks is at the foot of the
    Atomic Chihuahua.
  - Pretty keen, huh?

How do I defeat the puny planes?
  - Have you figured out what each of those buttons does?
  - The red button would certainly do the trick, but...
  - ...it's better to save the Chihuahua's precious fuel resources for later
    on.
  - When one of the planes is nearby the Atomic Chihuahua, PRESS THE WHITE
    BUTTON.

How should I deal with the Japanese marines in the park?
  - I suppose the black button would be quite effective.
  - But most of the marines, being veritable pillars of agility, would be
    able to scatter and escape the Atomic Chihuahua's wrath.
  - You aren't cheating are you? No, I didn't think so.
  - Anyway if you go through Uncle Buddy's record collection you'll find a
    copy of the Japanese National Anthem. Put the record on and when the
    marines stand at attention, PRESS THE BLACK BUTTON several times. That
    should take care of them.
  - Of course there are no marines or records and you're not cheating
    either, right?

How can I stop the missile from destroying the Atomic Chihuahua?
  - Pressing the red button will do the job but...
  - ...fuel is precious, and there's a better way to defeat the missile.
  - The tiny truck has a radar dish on it, which is pointing toward the
    Atomic Chihuahua.
  - The tiny truck is guiding the rocket toward the Chihuahua.
  - Therefore, destroying the truck will render the missile harmless.
  - Move the Atomic Chihuahua to the east end of the park, near the tiny
    truck, and then PRESS THE BLACK BUTTON.

How can I tell the Atomic Chihuahua to take the Big Diamond Ring?
  - First, you'll have to get the Chihuahua to the east end of the park.
  - Once you're there, just PRESS THE BLUE BUTTON.

The Chihuahua has the Big Diamond Ring. Now what?
  - You want to take the ring from him.
  - Since the model is encased in thick plastic, it won't be easy.
  - As you might have expected, you'll have to make a hole in the plastic
    dome.
  - As you might not have expected, you'll need to use the Atomic Chihuahua
    to do so.
  - If the Chihuahua breathes fire while he's close enough to the plastic
    dome, he'll melt a hole in the dome.
  - PRESS THE GREEN BUTTON until the Chihuahua's snout bumps up against the
    plastic dome. Then PRESS THE RED BUTTON three times. This should produce
    a hole big enough to reach through.

I'm pressing the red button but the Atomic Chihuahua is only gagging. What's
wrong?
  - Due to limited resources, the Atomic Chihuahua can breathe fire only
    three times.
  - So you'd better make each use of the red button count.
  - Don't use the red button to destroy tanks, planes or missiles. (If you
    aren't sure how to destroy the Chihuahua's enemies without using the red
    button, develop the hints to the appropriate questions above.)

How do I get up the stairs in the foyer?
  - You won't be able to stop the stairs from flattening out until you've
    been to the second floor.
  - You'll have to come up with another way to get upstairs.

How do I get to the second floor?
  - Have you tried walking up the stairs?
  - Hmmm. It's too bad this house doesn't have an elevator.
  - Or does it?
  - Give the closet a little extra scrutiny.

When I show the slide, all that appears on the screen is a blur of colored
light. What's going on?
  - Did you remember to focus the slide projector?

When I show the film strip, nothing appears on the screen. What's the
matter?
  - Did you remember to remove the lens cap?

Am I a victim of subliminal advertising when I show the film strip?
  - No.

Okay, what am I supposed to do in the Projection Booth?
  - There is a message on the slide and the strip of film.
  - Viewing the slide by itself or the strip of film by itself reveals only
    meaningless bits and pieces of the message.
  - Viewing both the strip of film and the slide at the same time reveals
    the message on the projection screen.
  - But you only have one turn to look at the message on the screen before
    the message disappears as the film strip runs through the projector.

Is the box of Cuban cigars important?
  - It was to Uncle Buddy.
  - Don't go on unless you've discovered the bust of Fidel Castro.
  - Remember, only develop the answers to questions you really need.

What can I do with the piano?
  - Have you tried playing it?
  - Playing the right song might cause something to happen.
  - Have you solved the Projection Booth puzzle yet?
  - If so, then you know what that song is.

Is there a way to enter the passage to the north of the crawlspace?
  - Yes.
  - The entrance to the passage is large enough for you to enter, but it's
    partially blocked by the ceiling.
  - Therefore, if you could raise the ceiling, you could enter the passage.

How do I raise the ceiling in the crawlspace?
  - Since the ceiling is balanced across a wooden beam, you can think of the
    ceiling as a see-saw of sorts.
  - If you could tip the ceiling down in one half of the crawlspace, it
    would effectively raise the ceiling in the other half.
  - First, you'll need to remove one of the pillars, since they're
    supporting the ceiling. See the next question for advice on how to go
    about doing that.
  - Then you'll have to redistribute the weight of the ceiling so that it
    presses down on the end of the ceiling from which you've removed the
    pillar.
  - Push the piano so that it rests over the end of the crawlspace from
    which you've removed a pillar. (You'll probably need to push it twice in
    the correct direction.) Doing this will tip the ceiling of the
    crawlspace.

How do I remove one of the pillars?
  - The ceiling of the crawlspace is very heavy. As the game starts,
    removing the pillars is impossible, since the ceiling's weight is evenly
    distributed.
  - If you could redistribute the ceiling's weight to one end of the
    crawlspace, you'd be able to remove the pillar at the other end.
  - Bear in mind that the ceiling of the crawlspace is also the floor of the
    parlor.
  - All of the furniture in the parlor is bolted down. All, that is, except
    the piano.
  - To get a pillar, go to the parlor, push the piano to the north or south,
    then go to the end of the crawlspace which is opposite to the direction
    in which you pushed the piano, and remove the pillar.


The Second Floor
****************

How do I open the panel in the ceiling?
  - "It won't budge from this side."
  - Oh well. At least you've learned that there's a room above this floor.
  - For more information on how to get to this room, refer to the next
    question.

I know that there's a room above the second floor, but I don't know how to
get there.
  - You'll need to use the closet/elevator to get there.
  - Have you ever been on top of the closet, by walking through one of the
    closet doors when the elevator is one floor below?
  - If the closet moved to the second floor while you were on top of it,
    you'd be at the attic!
  - However, there's no way to activate the elevator controls from the top
    of the closet.
  - Pull one of the closet pegs and read the description very closely.
  - The closet doesn't really move until a peg is released. When it snaps
    back up to its angled position, the elevator is activated.
  - What you need is a sort of timing device. Something to hold down the
    third peg for a few turns, giving you the time get [sic] on top of the
    closet.
  - Examine the bucket. Carefully.
  - It's rusting through on the bottom, and therefore bound to be a bit
    leaky.
  - You can fill the bucket with water at "Garden, North."
  - Bring the closet down to the cellar. Then go to "Garden, North" and fill
    the bucket. Quickly return to the closet. Hang the bucket on the third
    peg. Go to the foyer, open the closet door, and walk through it. If
    you're on top of the closet, just wait a few turns for the closet to
    move upward. If you didn't end up on top of the closet, you probably
    weren't quick enough in bringing the filled bucket to the closet. (Using
    the patio door is a good idea.)

What the heck is a newel?
  - It's a wooden knob, mounted on the bannister at the bottom or (in this
    case) the top of a staircase.

What's so unusual about the newel?
  - Have you tried examining it?
  - Have you tried turning it?
  - Now try walking down the stairs.
  - Turning the newel toggles a mechanism on or off. This is the mechanism
    which causes the stairs to flatten when you step on them.

How do I get the velvet sack?
  - If you merely open the window, the sack will fall to the ground,
    damaging its contents.
  - Since the top of the sack is sticking out from under the window, you can
    HOLD THE SACK before you OPEN THE WINDOW.


The Cellar
**********

What can I put in the computer's slot?
  - It's a pretty old contraption which dates back before the days of
    magnetic storage devices.
  - So, the slot probably accepts punch cards.

Egads! How do I remove the floppy disk from the disk drive!
  - Just open up the disk drive on your computer at home and remove the copy
    of _Hollywood Hijinx_ from the drive. It's that simple.
  - Of course, if you have a hard drive, this is not recommended.

Okay, how many cards will I need, and where will I find them?
  - You'll need seven cards -- one for each row of lights on the computer's
    display.
  - You should only develop the following seven clues if you're in dire
    need. Developing one of them will likely give away another puzzle in the
    game.
  - The blue card is located at the bottom of the closet shaft.
  - The green card is hidden behind the portrait of Aunt Hildegarde and
    Uncle Buddy which hangs in the hallway.
  - The indigo card is behind the loose brick in the fireplace.
  - The orange card is lying on the patio.
  - The red card is underneath the bath mat in the upstairs bathroom.
  - The violet card is inside the piano in the parlor.
  - The yellow card is in the screening room.
  - (this space intentionally left blank.)

Do I have to insert the cards in any order?
  - Yes.
  - Some of you may realize that the colors of the cards correspond to the
    colors of the rainbow.
  - There's another clue given on the business card in the mailbox.
  - ROY G. BIV
  - The correct order is red orange yellow green blue indigo violet.

I've put the cards into the computer in the correct order. Now what?
  - Look at the lights.
  - Now find a telephone and dial that number.
  - There are phones in the living room and in the master bedroom.


The Attic
*********

The attic? What attic?!
  - If you haven't yet been to the second floor of the mansion, don't
    continue to develop answers in this section.
  - Didn't the ceiling panel in the upstairs hall ever strike you as funny?
  - Or the sawed-off peg in the closet?
  - If you are stumped about how to get to the attic, refer to the questions
    about the ceiling panel and the "room above the second floor" in the
    "Second Floor" section.

Hey, the trunk won't open! What should I do?
  - Don't fret. Type OPEN THE PANEL.
  - Now, opening the trunk should be a cinch.


The Beach and Beyond
********************

Is there a way to climb back up the beach stairs?
  - No.

What should I do with the small, smoldering fire?
  - Putting it out might upset Morgan Fairchild.
  - She probably wouldn't mind if you use it to light matches and candles,
    though.

I'm swimming in the ocean. I'd like to swim underwater, but the undertow
here is too strong for me. What to do?
  - If you're not at the inlet, you're developing answers to the wrong
    question.
  - SWIM SOUTH into the cave. The undertow shouldn't be too bad there.

I keep running out of air when I'm swimming underwater. What should I do?
  - You should swim in the opposite direction of the current.
  - Enter the water at the Grotto and swim down, then down again. Next swim
    west, then up twice.

What do I do with the squid?
  - Fried Calamari is an excellent dish.
  - First kill the squid, then...
  - Wait a minute, there's no squid in _Hollywood Hijinx_.
  - And, hey! This question was in the Cutthroats Hintbooklet!
  - Sorry, due to a freak accident, this question escaped captivity and
    wriggled into this hintbooklet, puzzling all the experts, and throwing
    all sorts of schedules off by months.
  - You have our assurances, this won't happen again. And please, do try
    Fried Calamari the next time you eat out.

Gee, it's awfully dark in this cave. Is there any way to get some light in
here?
  - Any Boy Scout could tell you how.
  - You'll need to use a match.
  - Figure out a way to waterproof it.
  - Try lighting one of the candles and read the description carefully.
  - You can put wax from any lit candle on the match to waterproof it.

How do I open the hatch in the bomb shelter?
  - PULL THE CHAIN.

How do I get out of the bomb shelter?
  - The safe has potential. Potential energy, that is.
  - If the safe were to drop on one end of the plank...
  - ...and you were standing on other [sic] end, you would be catapulted
    upward.
  - Probably out of the bomb shelter if the hatch were open.
  - Open the hatch. PUSH THE RIGHT END OF THE PLANK DOWN. Light the rope on
    fire with any flame you've brought with you. Then get onto the right end
    of the plank and wait.

How do I open the safe?
  - If the safe is still suspended in the air, don't continue developing
    answers to this question. You'll have to figure out how to get the safe
    onto the ground first.
  - This is a combination safe, and the combination is right in front of
    you.
  - Read the plaque on the safe.
  - Hmmm. Levy, Regan, Lebling.
  - Left, Right, Left.
  - The name Levy has four letters in it.
  - The name Regan has five letters and Lebling has seven.
  - TURN THE DIAL LEFT TO 4. TURN IT RIGHT TO 5. TURN IT LEFT TO 7. OPEN THE
    SAFE.

Is there a way to return to the cliff from the bomb shelter?
  - If you haven't already escaped the bomb shelter once, you're developing
    answers to the wrong question. See the question, "How do I get out of
    the bomb shelter?"
  - Did you notice that ladder lying on the cliff?
  - Before you went back down into the bomb shelter did you drop the ladder
    in?
  - If so, then you can HANG THE LADDER ON THE HOOKS and CLIMB THE LADDER.


Prop Vault
**********

Prop vault? Have I missed something?
  - Yes, you have. Develop the hints in this section only if you've been to
    the vault. If you haven't been here, just keep playing -- you'll wind up
    here eventually.

How do I deal with Cousin Herman?
  - Why not do unto Herman as he does unto you?
  - There is a reason why Herman keeps picking up weapons and hitting you
    with them.
  - One of the weapons, in fact, will deliver quite a blow.
  - It's always the third weapon you pick up.
  - Hitting Herman with that weapon will knock him to his knees.

Yow! Uncle Buddy doesn't look so good. What should I do?
  - Call the make-up man?
  - No, Uncle Buddy hasn't aged too well. But after all he's been dead quite
    awhile.
  - Uncle Buddy? You have been to too many Hollywood parties. Uncle Buddy
    isn't here. He's buried at the Hollywood Memorial Park (near Marilyn).
    You're cheating. Remember what Aunt Hildegarde used to say: "Don't
    assume that long answers are associated with important questions."

Ack! How do I shut off the buzzsaw??
  - You'll have to get Herman out of the way first.
  - Once you have, just TURN OFF THE SAW.


General Questions
*****************

What are these pieces of paper with lines on them?
  - Each of the two pieces of paper is one half of something.
  - They're halves of a map, which depicts the hedge maze.
  - For more information, please see the question in the "Around the
    Grounds" section, entitled, "Where can I find a map of the hedge maze?"

I found a note and a peg. Where do I go?
  - "Come on down."
  - The peg-hole to the left of the set of pegs might have tipped you off
    that there's another floor below the cellar.
  - And that floor is where you should be heading at the moment.
  - The peg you found will help you to get there.
  - Just go to the elevator, and PUT THE PEG IN THE HOLE.
