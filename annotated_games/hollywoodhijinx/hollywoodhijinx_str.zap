	.GSTR STR?100," quickly realize why ""A Corpse Line"" could never be released: From the back of a large theatre the camera slowly pans in. The camera moves forward and you are able to make out a dozen or more figures lying side-by-side on the stage in glittering top hats. Then the music starts and the figures rise to their feet. The camera is now close enough to see more detail. The figures are corpses, some badly decayed, clad in top hats. They begin to dance in unison as the music swells. For a moment you forget they are corpses and begin to enjoy their mastery of the art.

Then the horror begins, just as it must have for Uncle Buddy. The line does a kick, and several legs fly into the audience. You feel your heart pounding as never before. The corpses, gripping each other's shoulders, turn at the same time and a half-dozen arms are pulled from their sockets. You can't seem to catch your breath. It's as if a pile of bricks were stacked on your chest. As the number ends, the corpses (what's left of them) remove their hats to take a bow. The camera moves in close as they bend over and you see the tops of their heads have been removed. You begin to shake uncontrollably, then you feel what seems like an explosion in your chest. The last thing you see is the corpses' brains plop onto the stage as they take their bow. You collapse."

You and Cousin Herman would race down these stairs in the summertime to see who would get to the water first. Usually Cousin Herman would trip you and win. A path in the grass leads west."

	.GSTR STR?217,"This is Aunt Hildegarde's kitchen. It is a fairly large, sterile area with several pieces of commercial-grade equipment to handle the vast amount of food needed for Hollywood parties. It is not exactly the kind of homey kitchen most people's aunts have. The whole family remembers the Christmas everyone received fruit cakes with serial numbers on them. A doorway leads to the east and stairs lead down from here."
	.GSTR STR?258,"This is the bottom landing. A rickety wooden walkway leads west. To the north is a sandy beach, and steep stairs lead up a rocky cliff."
	.GSTR STR?218,"This is the dining room with a long, walnut table and seating for twelve.

	.GSTR STR?271,"This is the entrance to the hedge maze. Aunt Hildegarde told you never to go into the maze without the map, and of course you would go in anyway and she would have to come in and find you.

Guests were forever getting lost in the maze at parties. Sometimes you wished Cousin Herman would go in and never come out. But you always had the feeling he was thinking the same about you, only more seriously. Tall hedges, thick and green, stretch along paths leading to the east and west and a grass path north enters the maze. A stone walkway leads south."
	.GSTR STR?195,"This is the living room where Uncle Buddy and Aunt Hildegarde used to spend their evenings. Most of the west wall is covered by a grand stone fireplace with a mantle over it. A long sofa, several cushy chairs and a telephone fill the room. Most of the hardwood floor is covered by a monstrous Persian rug. A doorway leads north and an archway exits to the east."
	.GSTR STR?192,"This is the screening room where Uncle Buddy died. He had a massive heart attack while viewing the final cut of his first horror musical, ""A Corpse Line."" The film was never released and no one knows what happened to the only full-length version, worth a fortune today. Rumor has it that as he was dying he proclaimed ""A Corpse Line"" to be his masterwork of horror. Other rumors say the film was so bad that, if it had been released and he hadn't died, someone would have killed him. Several rows of plush theatre-like seats face a movie screen. Doorways lead south and west."

	.GSTR STR?311,"Yesterday"
	.GSTR STR?272,"You are in a hedge maze of astonishing complexity. A path leads north."
	.GSTR STR?250,"You are in the orchid section of the garden. Tender orchid petals of every color surround a small pond here. The stone walkway leads north, southeast and southwest."
	.GSTR STR?245,"You are in the overpoweringly fragrant rose bush section of the garden. As you admire the roses you notice one somewhat sickly rose bush. Something about the sight of this particular rose bush makes you feel a bit queasy. The stone walkway leads northwest and southwest."
	.GSTR STR?264,"You are swimming in a shallow inlet, whose waters are much calmer than in the open ocean to the north. A sandy beach lies to the east and the mouth of a dark cave gapes open to the south."
	.GSTR STR?227,"You are swimming on the surface of the pool. The water sparkles, reflecting the light coming in from an opening to the north. To the east is a boat dock."
	.GSTR STR?244,"You bounce off a dwarf fig tree."
	.GSTR STR?226,"You bump into the wall of the cave."
	.GSTR STR?274,"You burrow furiously to no avail."
	.GSTR STR?278,"You can almost feel Aunt Hildegarde washing out your mouth with soap."
	.GSTR STR?324,"You can hear dogs howling in the distance."
	.GSTR STR?0,"You can see"
	.GSTR STR?5,"You can't "
	.GSTR STR?292,"You can't be serious."
	.GSTR STR?12,"You can't feed data to a computer that isn't turned on!
"
	.GSTR STR?249,"You couldn't bear to step on the tulips."
	.GSTR STR?283,"You don't need to use the word """
	.GSTR STR?232,"You feel a current coming from above and flowing east through the passage."
	.GSTR STR?231,"You feel a mild current flowing east. You have to grit your teeth to keep them from chattering in the cold water."
	.GSTR STR?322,"You hear the eerie whistling of wind coming down the chimney."
	.GSTR STR?150,"You jump off the cliff and fall to your death, just as you would expect from an Infocom story."
	.GSTR STR?228,"You lose your footing and plunge back into the water.[ID: bshelter:398]"
	.GSTR STR?366,"You march face first into a hedge"
	.GSTR STR?14,"You ski down the stairs then snowplow to a stop in the..."
	.GSTR STR?148,"You ski down the steep path, unable to stop at the cliff. You sail off the cliff into the air, catching a very brief glimpse of Linda Ronstadt's beach house, then plummet to the rocks below."
	.GSTR STR?152,"You slip the skis on, then slip off the roof."
	.GSTR STR?266,"You start to go down, but feeling a strong undertow, you decide against it."
	.GSTR STR?164,"You step into a shaft and plunge down, slowing ever so slightly as your body crashes through the top of the closet then abruptly comes to a stop on the floor of the closet."
	.GSTR STR?154,"You step into the gap and plunge down onto the sharp rocks below."
	.GSTR STR?158,"You step into the gap and plunge to the rocks below in a spectacular fall worthy of Hollywood's best stuntmen. Your body smashes onto the rocks. Too bad you didn't have a stunt double."
	.GSTR STR?262,"You stroll down the beach, declining several invitations to nude hot tub parties, then return to the end of the beach."
	.GSTR STR?273,"You walk face first into the hedge."
	.GSTR STR?365,"You walk right into a thick hedge"
	.GSTR STR?6,"You wouldn't even be able to dog paddle wearing a pair of skis."
	.GSTR STR?7,"You'd better take the bucket off the peg first.

	.GSTR STR?256,"You're about halfway down the steep staircase, which creaks under your weight. There are several steps missing here. It's quite a gap: probably more than you could jump across. On the other side of the gap, the stairs continue down. Climbing up the stairs returns to the landing."
	.GSTR STR?257,"You're about halfway up the steep stairs. There are several steps of the stairs missing here. It's quite a gap: probably more than you could jump across. On the other side of the gap stairs continue up. Climbing down the stairs returns to the beach."
	.GSTR STR?201,"You're doing your best to keep your balance here on the roof. During a fierce storm you can see Linda Ronstadt's house wash into the ocean from here. A chimney juts up from the roof here and there is another chimney to the east, near the end of the roof."
	.GSTR STR?198,"You're in the chimney, above the fireplace. You can see a couple of holes here in the chimney where bricks used to be. The chimney continues upward and the fireplace is below."
	.GSTR STR?199,"You're inside the chimney. You can see a couple of holes here in the chimney where bricks used to be. The chimney continues upward and downward."
	.GSTR STR?237,"You're on a wet, narrow ledge in a dripping underground cave. There is a pool of blackness to the south and a tunnel leads north."
	.GSTR STR?239,"You're standing in front of the house where you spent many of your summers as a youngster. The old place is not as big as it seemed to you then, but it is still quite large. Stone pathways wind east and west around the house, and a larger main walkway leads north."
	.GSTR STR?200,"You're standing in the chimney. There are a couple of holes here in the chimney where bricks used to be. This chimney doesn't lead any further down, only up."
	.GSTR STR?243,"You're standing on a stone walkway in Aunt Hildegarde's much envied garden where she would spend hours tending to her flowers, bushes and trees. The garden was off limits to you as a child because of an incident one summer when you and Cousin Herman were playing in the garden. You suggested pretending to be wild African animals and climbed a tree and began to screech as if a baboon while Cousin Herman ran off toward the roses shouting something about being a rhinoceros.

After howling until your throat felt like you had puffed on one of Uncle Buddy's Hollywood cigars, you went to find Cousin Herman. When you arrived you couldn't believe your eyes -- Cousin Herman had pulled all the thorns off of all of Aunt Hildegarde's rose bushes in a quest to find the biggest thorn possible so he could be a rhino. Of course when Aunt Hildegarde saw her naked rose bushes, Cousin Herman blamed it all on you. The walkway leads south, northeast and northwest."
	.GSTR STR?248,"You're standing on a stone walkway in the tulip section of the garden. The walkway leads northeast and southeast."
	.GSTR STR?254,"You're standing on the front porch of the house. Next to the front door is a regulation mailbox endorsed by Buck Palace. Beneath the mailbox is a doorbell once rung by Sonny Tufts. To the south is a walkway."
	.GSTR STR?277,"You've earned an 'R' rating."
	.GSTR STR?238,"Your soggy footsteps echo through the long, slimy corridor which runs up, towards a dry area, and south, toward dripping noises."
