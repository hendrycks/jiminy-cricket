Suddenly, in the middle of the night, a wave of water washes over you. Before you can quite get your bearings, you drown."
	.GSTR STR?119,"


Suddenly, in the middle of the night, you awake as several ferocious beasts (could they be grues?) surround and attack you. Perhaps you should have found a slightly safer place to sleep."

The microbe wraps several pseudopods around you and shoves you into its mucus-covered gullet. Digestive juices begin their work. The experience is not pleasant."
	.GSTR STR?113,"
The pod splits open, and water pours in."
	.GSTR STR?109,"
The pod, whose automated controls were unfortunately designed by computer scientists, lands with a good deal of force. Your body sails across the pod until it is stopped by one of the sharper corners of the control panel."
	.GSTR STR?107,"
The ship rocks from the force of multiple explosions. The lights go out, and you feel a sudden drop in pressure accompanied by a loud hissing. Too bad you weren't in the escape pod..."
	.GSTR STR?207,"
With a furious storm of electrical mayhem, Sector 384 comes to life. A few micro-volts course through the silicon strip on which you stand. Unfortunately, at your current size, this is enough to barbecue you."
	.GSTR STR?104,"
You are thrown against the bulkhead, head first. It seems that getting in the safety webbing would have been a good idea."
	.GSTR STR?125,"
You collapse from extreme thirst and hunger."
	.GSTR STR?128,"
You finally succumb to the ravages of your illness and collapse."

	.GSTR STR?359," isn't notably helpful."
	.GSTR STR?45," Some information appears on the screen."
	.GSTR STR?210," The microbe, whipped into a rabid frenzy by the waves of heat from the pulsing laser, literally lunges at it. You jump back and, losing your balance, fall over the edge of the strip. The microbe, writhing madly, hurls itself after its prey. You and the microbe both plunge into the void below."
	.GSTR STR?183," Unfortunately, you don't seem to be that hardy."
	.GSTR STR?379,"...At last, the Feinstein has arrived at the historic Nebulon system. It's been five months since the last shore leave, and you're anxious for Planetfall. You and some other Ensigns Seventh Class enter the shuttle for surfaceside. Suddenly, you're alone on the shuttle, and it's tumbling out of control! It lands in the ocean and begins sinking! You try to clamber out, but you are stuck in a giant spider web. A giant spider crawls closer and closer..."
	.GSTR STR?377,"...Strangely, you wake to find yourself back home on Gallium. Even more strangely, you are only eight years old again. You are playing with your pet sponge-cat, Swanzo, on the edge of the pond in your backyard. Mom is hanging orange towels on the clothesline. Suddenly the school bully jumps out from behind a bush, grabs you, and pushes your head under the water. You try to scream, but cannot. You feel your life draining away..."
	.GSTR STR?375,"...You find yourself on the bridge of the Feinstein. Ensign Blather is here, as well as Admiral Smithers. You are diligently scrubbing the control panel. Blather keeps yelling at you to scrub harder. Suddenly you hit the ship's self-destruct switch! Smithers and Blather howl at you as the ship begins exploding! You try to run, but your feet seem to be fused to the deck..."
	.GSTR STR?376,"...You gulp down the last of your Ramosian Fire Nectar and ask the andro-waiter for another pitcher. This pub makes the finest Nectar on all of Ramos Two, and you and your shipmates are having a pretty rowdy time. Through the windows of the pub you can see a mighty, ancient castle, shining in the light of the three Ramosian moons. The Fire Nectar spreads through your blood and you begin to feel drowsy..."
	.GSTR STR?378,"...Your vision slowly returns. You are on a wooded cliff overlooking a waterfall. A rainbow spans the falls. Blather stands above you, bellowing that the ground is filthy -- scrub harder! You throw your brush at Blather, but it passes thru him as though he were a ghost, and sails over the cliff. Blather leaps after the valuable piece of Patrol property, and both plummet into the void..."
