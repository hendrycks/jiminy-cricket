exploding! You try to run, but your feet seem to be fused to the deck..."

all of Ramos Two, and you and your shipmates are having a pretty rowdy
time. Through the windows of the pub you can see a mighty, ancient castle,

through your blood and you begin to feel drowsy..."

strangely, you are only eight years old again. You are playing with your
pet sponge-cat, Swanzo, on the edge of the pond in your backyard. Mom is
hanging orange towels on the clothesline. Suddenly the school bully jumps
out from behind a bush, grabs you, and pushes your head under the water.
You try to scream, but cannot. You feel your life draining away..."

"...Your vision slowly returns. You are on a wooded cliff overlooking
a waterfall. A rainbow spans the falls. Blather stands above you, bellowing
that the ground is filthy -- scrub harder! You throw your brush at Blather,
but it passes thru him as though he were a ghost, and sails over the cliff.
Blather leaps after the valuable piece of Patrol property, and both plummet
into the void..."

been five months since the last shore leave, and you're anxious for
Planetfall. You and some other Ensigns Seventh Class enter the shuttle for
surfaceside. Suddenly, you're alone on the shuttle, and it's tumbling out of
