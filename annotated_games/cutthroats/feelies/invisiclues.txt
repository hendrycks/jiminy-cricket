Red Boar Inn
************

Who slipped the note under my door?
  A. Have you read it?
  B. If you have then you know...
  C. ...Johnny slipped you the note.

I can't find my room key. What should I do?
  A. Did you leave it in the lock?

  C. But that is about all he's good for in this story.

Someone broke into my room. Should I call the police?
  A. There's only one thing on this island shabbier than your room and
     that's the security at the Red Boar Inn.

     know.

  D. Be careful not to rupture a water main or the cellar will fill with

************************

How do I rent a boat?
  A. You can't afford it alone.
  B. You'll have to throw in with Johnny.
  C. Let Johnny take care of it.

Johnny stormed out of Outfitters. What went wrong?
  A. If you haven't met Johnny at Point Lookout, don't develop any more
     answers for this question.
  B. One of two things may have gone wrong.
  C. You carried your passbook into Outfitters, and McGinty was there and
     saw it...
  D. ...so he knew you were up to something.
  E. Or you tried to rent or buy something in front of McGinty...
  F. ...so he knew you were up to something.
  G. Wait for McGinty to leave before you buy or rent anything.

Should I buy any of the following items?

  Diving Book
    A. You already know the ins and outs of diving.
    B. Therefore, you don't need the diving book.

  Nautical Charts
    A. Hmmmm, a chart would come in handy...
    B. ...but $150 is a lot of clams.
    C. Better use the one in the shipwreck book.

  Flashlight
    A. You'll need one if you're going diving. It's dark down there.
    B. $24 is a lot of clams for a flashlight...
    C. ...and this is a lot of flashlight.
    D. Buy it.

  Dry Cell
       You'll need it to power something.

  Recording of Popular Whale Songs
    A. You won't want to miss this monster album.
    B. Hits like "Oooouuououm if you love me," and the ever-popular
       "Oooooouuuuuuaaaaaaaaauuuoop" (dance track).
    C. These are songs that your whole family will enjoy.
    D. This recording is not available in any store, not even Outfitters.
    E. So why are you wasting your time developing this clue?

  Tube of Putty
    A. This waterproof putty will fix any crack or leak you encounter.
    B. It might come in handy when you're underwater.
    C. If you are salvaging the Leviathan, you'll need the putty.

  C Battery
       You'll need this to power something.

  Net
    A. Do you plan on doing some fishing?
    B. If you do, then you'll want to bring this along.
    C. But why would you want to go fishing when there is treasure to be
       found?
    D. You don't need the net.

  Spear Gun
    A. A spear gun would be nice to have.
    B. Especially if you plan on doing some diving in dangerous waters.
    C. It's too bad that Outfitters doesn't have any in stock.

  Compass
    A. Why would you want a compass, with your keen sense of direction?
    B. Unfortunately, not everyone is so clear-headed.
    C. Outfitters doesn't have any in stock.

  Location Box
    A. You have only $603 in your bank account. You'll need another $397.
    B. How are you going to get the extra cash?
    C. Have you tried robbing the bank?
    D. Well, maybe that isn't such a good idea.
    E. There's no way that you can possibly afford the location box...
    F. ...and you don't need it anyway.

  Portable Electromagnet
    A. It seems to be quite attractive (groan!).
    B. You may find a need for it.
    C. If you've rented the Mary Margaret, then you don't have enough money
       to buy the magnet.
    D. If you are salvaging the Leviathan, you'll need the electromagnet.

  Water Wings
    A. You don't need to buy the water wings. They're free with every
       purchase of $10 or more.
    B. Water wings? What water wings?
    C. Remember, Diver Dan says, "For safety's sake, don't assume the
       presence of a question means it's important. Also don't assume long
       answers are always associated with important questions."

  Shark Repellent Canister
    A. Have you tried diving without any protection from sharks?
    B. If you have, you'll realize that $20 is a small price to pay for your
       legs.
    C. You'd better buy the shark repellent.

  Winch
    A. This might come in handy if you're looking for a way to pull
       something up...
    B. ...but you might as well save your money...
    C. ...because you and the crew will be able to haul up just about
       anything.
    D. You don't need the winch.

  Anchor
    A. It's likely the ship you rent will come equipped with one.
    B. You don't need the anchor.

Should I rent any of the following items?

  Small Air Compressor
    A. Have you examined your air tank?
    B. Pretty low, huh?
    C. Diver Dan says, "For safety's sake, never dive without air in your
       tank."
    D. If you're renting the Night Wind, you'll need to rent the compressor.
    E. The Mary Margaret comes equipped with an air compressor.

  Diving Cage
    A. You don't have enough money.
    B. So you can't rent it.
    C. Which is convenient since you don't need it.

  A. Not bad. It'll really hit the spot.
  B. If you want some food, type BUY A MEAL or ORDER FOOD.

  A. What'll you have, water or grog?
  B. If you'd like water, type BARTENDER, GIVE ME SOME WATER.
  C. If it's grog you want, type BARTENDER, GIVE ME SOME GROG.
  D. But Diver Dan says, "For safety's sake, don't drink too much. Remember:
     Friends don't let friends dive drunk."
  E. And besides, if you drink too much, you'll probably end up passing out
     and getting killed.

I'm drunk. How do I sober up?
  A. What about a cold shower?
  B. There doesn't seem to be any shower on the island.
  C. No wonder everyone on the island smells so bad.

**************

What can I do here?
  A. Absolutely nothing...

  C. Type GO SOUTH.


The Back Alley
**************

Why is this a point of interest?

     located along this alley.

     wearing your water wings on your feet.
  E. Well, maybe that isn't such a good idea...
  F. ...since there isn't any Indian Burial Ground.
  G. There's plenty of developing fluid, but save it for the answers you
     really need.

Johnny wants to know if the treasure is deeper than 200 feet. What should I
tell him?

  H. McGinty takes it back to his office.
  I. Of course, the meeting won't take place if McGinty has no reason to be
     suspicious (like if he never saw you and Johnny together in Outfitters
     International).

his desk. What can I do with it?
  A. Have you examined the object?
  B. It is an envelope containing the Weasel's collateral for the deal made
     at the ferry landing.
  C. Have you tried taking it?
  D. It seems to be quite important to McGinty, doesn't it?

  A. If you don't know about the envelope, see the previous question.
  B. You'll have to get the envelope in McGinty's office.

     which.

  E. Use the small machine.
  F. It's a metal detector.
  G. Did you buy the dry cell and put it into the machine before you dove?
