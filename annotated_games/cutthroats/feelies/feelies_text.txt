RAMBLING WITH JACK: A LETTER FROM THE EDITOR 
 
In the brotherhood of true adventurers, no name was more revered than that of Moose Moose Llasko. I say was because it saddens
me to report that Moose has passed into the Great Beyond, a victim in a hopeless wrestling match with a giant octopus who attacked
his underwater bagpipes quartet.
I always admired Moose because in many ways he reminded me of myself. Like him, I wasn’t exactly born with a silver spoon in my
mouth. Oh, no. A kid growing up in Hell’s Kitchen learns pretty early about survival of the fittest. Or he doesn’t survive. I remember,
for instance, the time in kindergarten when I dropped my crayon and little Danny Esterhazy kicked me in the teeth. And then there was
the time when I was holding the ball for a field goal in the Thanksgiving Day dame, and Danny Esterhazy deliberately missed the
ball and kicked me in the teeth. But most of all, I recall my senior prom. And how my date and I snuck outside the rec hall for a little
necking. There was light, cool breeze in the air, and the fragrance of the river was in our nostrils, and I could feel the wet grass through
the holes in soles of my two-tones. It was a magic moment indeed  and then and there, gazing into my girl’s eyes, I made the most
important decision of my life. I knelt down on one knee, and began stammering my proposal. And she kicked me in the teeth. I later
found out Danny Esterhazy paid her to do it.
I learned a lot from those childhood experiences in Hell’s Kitchen. I learned that life is a jungle. I learned that after a certain point, all
the reconstructive dental surgery and expensive braces in the world won’t make a bit difference. And I learned the real survivors are the
ones who end up in the NICE UPTOWN OFFICE BUILDINGS with GORGEUS SECRETARIES and jobs which let them SEE THE
WORLD and WRITE WIDELY READ EDITORIAL OBITUARIES about their FAMOUS FRIENDS! Think about that while you’re
peddling papers at your corner newsstand, Danny Esterhazy, you bum.
Anyway, this issue is dedicated to Moose Moose Llasko, a real nice guy.
’Til next month, Jack Jack Zumwalt, Managing Editor


OUR READERS'S OWN TRUE TALES OF ADVENTURE

Steaming in the Tropics 
The Mogga Beast is dead. None of the natives dared brave its poisonous tentacles and lashing spiked tail, so they hired me to do the
dirty work for a cool million clams. After chumming the water near the Great Reef to stir the creature’s bloodlust, I dove in and
watched from beneath a coral arch. Not one minute after I’d reached my hiding place, I saw Mogga slithering through the murk, all fifty
horrifying feet of the brute. And he saw me  my bubbles had given me away.
It was do or die. The beast was almost upon me before I’d uncapped the dart. He took a swipe at me with his anterior tentacle, but in
his frenzy, he missed by a hairbreadth. And that gave me the split second I needed to pump 20 cc’s of strychnine into his gaping maw.
That night, I delivered Mogga’s head to the chieftain.
My problem is this: Does anybody have any suggestions on where I can unload 1673 bushels of cherrystones? Fishmarkets, rush your
orders now! These things are starting to stink up the joint.

The name has been bandied about in the press to such an extent that I need not identify the subject of this letter. Suffice to say that this
explorer boldly threw caution to the wind and championed my effort to locate the phantom pyramid whose existence my father had
postulated. That the quest ended in indescribable horror is the world’s tragedy. In the words of The Bard: Sleep well, heroic soul, O!
let/ Not dread Isis’ sandfleas in thy khakis get.

The rat had it coming! Commandeered MY expedition, and cut me completely out of the action. Don’t believe one word of that sob

shove your resumes! From now on, I go it alone.

THE RETURN OF THE NATIVES
Ray Lilly and Bill Burroughs knew there was a fabulous treasure lying somewhere below the dark waters off
Pagu Reef.
All they had to do was find the right natives to lead them to it.
Bill and Ray had plenty to smile about on their arrival back in the States. After their press
conference, they were hustled off to a nasal surgeon for reconstructive surgery.]
IT’S TRUE! say the intrepid adventurers in unison. We won fame and fortune in the South
Seas! Today, Ray and Bill live a life of opulence in their Florida Keys compound. And, as Bill
says, We earned every bit of it!
For 10 years prior to their Pagu adventure, the two had run a marginally successful salvage
business in the Florida Keys. Then one day, Ray decided they should return to the South Sea
island of Pagu where he had been stationed as a Merchant Marine just before the Korean War.
Thirty years ago, Ray had heard Pagu’s Pug Pap tribesmen talk of rare gems that were trapped in ancient sunken wrecks off Pagu.
Luckily, I believed every word of it, Ray said, and I knew that the only way to get a crack at that treasure would be to ’go native.’
Lilly recalls: After life in America, it was tough becoming a native again. But we learned to adjust to the Pug Pap ways  the
hammocks, the Yik Fish Stew, the roast grubs and the ’dress.’ Of course, Bill and I weren’t trying to be Margaret Mead-type
anthropologists; we were strictly in it for the money.
After about eight months of acculturation, we were able to recruit two Pug Pap guides who would take us out on the reefs to some of
their sacred fishing grounds. ’Magic Lim’ and ’B.C.,’ as we called our two companions, proved to be able, if somewhat superstitious,
partners. They refused to dive. But they did show us where some of the wrecks ’might’ be found.
We worked some of the world’s most treacherous waters in those two years. Deep cuts between islands where the current came
through like a freight train. Underwater cliffs. And shark-infested reefs where no man had ever dived before.
Finally, in out twenty-first month, we started finding some giant rock outcroppings that looked like the hulls of ships. After eight dives
to one particularly promising site, we hit pay dirt. Bill went down about nine fathoms, and I was up top on shark watch with B.C.
Suddenly, Bill burst to the surface holding a fiery red rock about the size of a golf ball in his hand. When the sun hit it and it sparkled,
my heart nearly came out of my throat. It was the biggest ruby I had ever seen.
The rest, as you know, is history. We spent the next three months hauling gems out of the belly of the old boat and ferrying them back
to the island. Eight million dollars worth. We unloaded most of the take in Hong Kong, then flew back to Pagu with a team from the
Natural Graphic Society. They had hoped to bring the old stone boat up. It was too heavy. But Bill and I had what he wanted. We were
millionaires!
Editor’s note: Burroughs and Lilly have established a Trust Fund for the native tribes of Pagu and neighboring islands as thanks for their
unflagging assistance throughout the operation.

DANGER AT FIFTY FATHOMS!
by Hoble Brinston
IT’S TRUE! THE NATIVE SHRIEKED. BIG PEARL  BIG LIKE A MONSTER! Sure, I’m a deep-sea diver.
Who isn’t? Have been most of my life. But that doesn’t mean I’ve ever run into a 2,000-pound oyster wrapped around
400-pound pearl. I mean, gimme a break!
I stared at the pitiful native and narrowed my eyes. I tried to imagine a pearl that large and how I could get a
photograph of it for this issue of TRUE TALES OF ADVENTURE.
Yeah, sure, I quipped in true adventurer’s fashion. And where did you see this pearl?
The wretched native shuffled his feet and stared at the sand, digging his big toes into gleaming white silica. You pay and I take you
out there, he said.
Sounded fair to me. I had the underwater camera, some unused film and some dough from a risky but profitable raft trip up the Congo,
so I was halfway there already. I figured I’d better outfit myself for the dive, though, since cameras don’t help you breathe underwater.
And the first thing I needed to know was what kind of equipment I would need.

"A diver without Equipment is like a Fish without Gills"
It’s true, I thought as I wandered over to the marina and checked out what they had. The standard stuff, scuba equipment, was
something I was very familiar with. I knew what kind of tanks I’d need, and I also knew that I’d need fins and a wet suit.
Scuba gear, as all you divers know, has its limits. You wouldn’t want to go mucking about in the deep blue sea deeper than 250 feet or
so in scuba gear. You’d use up your air so fast, you wouldn’t even have time to blink!
The marina had a complete line of deep-sea diving gear, too, which included diving suits, air compressors and those cute metal
helmets.
Anyway, I figured since the native diver had spotted the pearl in the oyster and he’d done it without deep-sea diving equipment, all I’d
needed for a successful dive was the scuba outfit.
I made sure my tanks were fully charged (no sense running off half-cocked) and loaded the stuff onto the boat. The native arrived at
just the right time for us to catch the tide, and we took off onto the ocean blue, whitecaps just starting to form.
If he’d been much later, we would have had to put off the whole expedition, but he seemed to have an intuition about when the tide
would be in. At low tide, it would have been treacherous and downright suicidal to depart from the tiny harbor, possibly puncturing out
bottom on the coral reefs, in the attempt.

"Cocktails for Two"
It’s true, the person in the marina warned. Dive too deep in scuba gear and you can end up in more water than you can shake a stick
at. Well, I sure found myself over my head on this fateful day, and if it wasn’t for well, if it wasn’t for my quick thinking and
decisiveness, I wouldn’t be relating this true story right now.
Anyway, it seems I stayed down a little too long. Or maybe I dived a little too deep? But there I was with my camera on the ocean
floor, with this huge mother-of-pearl staring me right in the kisser. I quickly unfolded the camera and set it up, getting just the right
angle.
I had been fiddling with the focus and the exposure setting quite a while when I suddenly got this creepy feeling that I was being
watched  that I was not alone! I looked around, but all was still. Suddenly, something moved about 20 feet in front of me! It was big 
too big for me to ignore. Could have been a barracuda, or a shark, or any one of a hundred horrible things. I dared not move, but the
bubbles from my air tank continued to rise and made my location a dead giveaway.
A few more minutes passed, and nothing happened. Nothing in front of me moved. I shook my head, figuring my imagination was
playing tricks on me. I realized that the huge oyster was there before me, mouth staring to open wide, and the time for taking the
picture I’d carefully planned for was now.
As I looked through the viewfinder, something strange happened. From behind me I heard a voice, a woman’s voice, humming! I
turned around as quick as a dart fish, but only in time to see the colorful caudal fin of some large fish swimming away.
By now I was sure that I was hallucinating; nitrogen narcosis, perhaps, was setting in. I figured I had only five more minutes
underwater before I ran out of air completely. Once again, I looked through the viewfinder and saw the incredible pearl in perfect
focus. I reached for the shutter release. Now, I coached myself. Take the picture and go up.
Focus in and find the finest, a voice said behind me.
I whipped around and there, smiling at me, head titled coyly, was a beautiful mermaid! I stepped back in wonder and awe; I vaguely
recall bumping into my tripod and watching my camera fall onto the pearl. The oyster closed up, and my camera was gone!
The mermaid laughed. Specially focused with a narrow, even beam, she said.
My initial shock turned to curiosity  and fear. Was this magnificent underworld creature trying to tell me something, or warn me of
some danger? If so, I could not decipher her cryptic messages. But before I could think of something to say, she sang, Contact,
efficient and rechargeable. Then, with a wave of her hand and a flip of her tail, she was gone!
Oh, how I wish I could have followed! But as Fate would have it, I had barely enough oxygen to get to the surface. Sadly, I looked one
last time at the closed oyster, which contained my expensive equipment and a much more valuable gem. Longingly, I looked toward
the shadows into which the mermaid had disappeared; but there was, of course, nothing to see, and I started up. I began my ascent not a
second too soon, for my tanks were empty when I reached the surface.
The pearl! the native shrieked. Did you see it?
I nodded my head. I had seen it all, and it’s all true.

REFURBISHED REGULATORS
Better Than New! 
Whether you’re diving in the icy waters of the North Atlantic or the sandy depths of the South Pacific, you want a regulator you can
trust. That’s why so many divers use Imperial refurbished regulators; a thermoplastic valve system prevents ice-up in even coldest
waters, and all Imperial products are 100 percent corrosion-free. Most other regulators require adjustments in the first or second stages
of diving, but Imperial refurbished regulators adjust automatically, maintaining a steady flow for easy breathing.
Inhalation effort and capacity of oxygen regulated remains approximately unchanged continually regardless of depth, tank pressure or
diver position.
Stan Newberry, Professional Diver
DID YOU KNOW?
There are 598 cherrystone clams in a bushel.

You are a daring deep-sea driver held up on Hardscrabble Island, a dying little seaport all but 
forgotten. The tiny island offers little entertainment or diversions, and diving off the 
treacherous reefs has long since lost its charm. So when a note is slipped under your bedroom 
door offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, you're ready to take the plunge. 
 
True, your cohorts are untrustworthy. Granted, keeping the sunken treasure a secret is 
practically impossible on such a small island. Naturally, diving alone in new areas is 
dangerous, But if you can keep your head and get the treasure, the riches will more than 
offset the risks you have to take. 
 
Fortunately, this package contains some of the most important information you'll need to 
succeed on you adventure: a book entitled Four Shipwrecks off Hardscrabble Island; a map 
showing where the shipwrecks went down; a price list from Outfitter's International, where 
you may purchase the necessary diving equipment, and a table listing high and low tides. 
None of these will help you, though, unless you're able to join in league with some of the 
shadiest characters this side of Davy Jones' locker, brave the seas and use you resources to 
cheat death. 
 
Good luck, matey. You'll need it.

INTRODUCTION
FROM THE TIME IT WAS FOUNDED by Reverend Gladstone and his followers in 1692 until the decline of the fishing
industry in the 1920s, Hardscrabble Harbor was an important port for the sailing ships of the world. Its deep channel
offered sufficient draught for everything from sloops to the giant five-masters of the late nineteenth century. (Islanders
who remember the Harbors boom years say that at times there were more foreign sailors roaming the Wharf Road than
there were Hardscrabble natives.)
However, like any other seaport, Hardscrabble has its treacherous shoals and narrow straits. Consequently, a side effect
of the great sea trade was a number of shipwrecks. This volume concerns four of the most famous vessels to go down in
our waters: The Săo Vera, the H.M.S. Intransigent, The Fianna and the S. S. Leviathan.
Many stories have sprung up over the years in regard to the fates of these ships. Some of these tales are based on fact;
others are little more than strands in the fabric of local legend. By searching through the town archives (and in the case
of the Leviathan, conducting interviews with survivors), we have endeavored to separate truth from fiction.
While the subject of this book is one of tragedy and great loss of human life, we hope it will prove enlightening to the
readers, as well as valuable to anyone who might wish to explore these old and historic wrecks.

SÃO VERA
THE SĂO VERA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST transatlantic cargo ships,
carrying gold coins and jewels to Portugal from its colonies in
the New World. The ship was built to carry a crew of 110, and
had a wide stern to allow for a great cabin aft in the style of
the large merchantmen of the day. One of her most striking
characteristics was a figurehead in the shape of a lion.
Dame Fortune seems to have smiled on the Săo Vera at first.
During her maiden voyage, she struck a reef near the island of
Santo, but against all odds limped to the Brazilian mainland
with no loss of life or cargo. A year later, the Spanish set fireships
laden with explosives adrift in Recife Harbor, destroying
much of the Portuguese merchant fleet moored there; the Săo
Vera, however, was in dry-dock for repairs and escaped
unscathed.
Tragically, her luck failed to hold out through the succession of
violent gales that pummeled her in the fall of 1698. The first of
these blew the ship off her course for Rio de Janeiro in mid-
October, causing severe damage to the hull. Before this could
be repaired, a second gale swept down on the Săo Vera,
carrying her into the waters near Hardscrabble Island, where
she foundered for days. The fatal blow was struck when a third vicious storm broke upon the disabled vessel.
The captain, Juan Estaban del Cano, went down with his ship, and all hands save two were lost. The
survivors managed to make their way to Chocteague Neck by clinging to a broken spar. They were pulled
from the icy waters, frostbitten and near the point of hysteria, by passing fishermen two days later.

H. M. S. INTRANSIGENT
THE INTRANSIGENT WAS A BRITISH WARSHIP of the frigate
variety. She was used by the Royal Navy primarily for
patrolling the sea lanes between Africa and North
America in the eighteenth century, although it was
rumored that one of her skippers, Icy Will Bose, secretly
employed the ship for smuggling slaves and ivory to the
colonies.
This man-o-war was armed with 40 guns and led a
colorful history. In 1845, for example, she was attacked
by corsairs while anchored off the Ivory Coast, but
managed to escape by cutting her cable. Three years
later, she was engaged in an action against a French
convoy near Gibraltar. Disaster was turned to victory,
however, when the captain of the Intransigent, Sir Harle
Perkins, skillfully lured the enemy into the Straits, where a
detachment of British warships waylaid and routed the
French forces. Pirates commandeered her for a brief
time in 1759 by attacking at night and overpowering the
sleeping crew, but they were caught and hung on what
was then known as Hipaniola (an island which has since
been divided into the Caribbean nations of Haiti and the
Dominican Republic) shortly thereafter.
Captain Bose took command of the Intransigent in 1761. It sank under extremely mysterious circumstances
five years later, in 1766. Bose, who was said to have survived, was never heard from again. A number of
unreliable sources reported him living in luxury somewhere in the West Indies, and one story claimed that he
eventually died in a dual over a certain lady of British nobility. None of these tales has ever been
substantiated.

--

THE FIANNA
THE FIANNA WAS ORIGINALLY KNOWN as the Gloria Dieu, a
British tea clipper built for speed to race across the great
distances of the China Trade routes. She was designed by
Phineas Hayes, then commissioner of Chatham Yard, and
was laid down in Woolrich in 1869. The vessel was
composite-built; that is, while she was an ironclad, her keel,
stem, and sternpost were of wood.
The Gloria Dieu did very well at the tea trade, and later, when
the Suez Canal put it at a disadvantage to the newer steamships
in that line, she was converted over to the Australian
wool trade. It was while she was sailing from Melbourne to
Liverpool in late 1878 that she was attacked, boarded and
hijacked by Iron Mike Quinn, the last of the great pirates.
Iron Mikes men ruthlessly murdered the entire crew of the
Gloria Dieu, and the pirate king himself rechristened the
clipper The Fianna after a legendary band of Gaelic warrior
heroes. The next nine years were bloody pages in the story
of the vessel. Under Iron Mikes iron hand, the cold-bloodedly
efficient buccaneers pillaged and plundered the high seas,
raiding more than 150 merchant ships.

There are several widely disparate versions of how The Fianna finally went down. The most believable of
these stories is that after Iron Mike and his crew relieved the Scottish mercantile vessel Donalwald of its cargo
of rare whiskey in 1887, they failed to notice a partially submerged ledge located to the northwest of
Hardscrabble Island. It is believed that currents caused her to drift form the point where she was lost.

S. S. LEVIATHAN
IN 1903, HOLLYWOOD CRUISE LINES announced its intention of
constructing a new 30,000-ton express steamer. The Leviathan
was to be the last word in all that constituted luxury, from the
extremely rare materials used in the decoration and paneling of
the ships many saloons and lounges to the extraordinary
plushness of the private suites and cabins. The Leviathan was
also designed to be faster than any competing cruiseship of her
timewithout sacrificing passenger comfort.
The vessels speed might have saved her had it not been for a
last-minute compromise by the directors. A decision was
reached to increase the amount of space allotted to first-class
passengers. However, because of the extravagant size of each
first-class compartment, it was necessary to borrow space
from other parts of the ship.
This ultimately resulted in a modification of the hull, which
compromised the Leviathans ability to achieve her originally
specified top speed. Otherwise, she might have been able to
outdistance the German warship that sent her to the bottom
near Hardscrabble Island in 1916 at least long enough for help
to have arrived. As it was, all passengers escaped in lifeboats,
but Mr. Alexander Mooreheads famed stamp collection,
encased in glass, was lost, along with many other items of value. The Germans later excused the sinking by
claiming that the U.S. was using the Leviathan to ship weapons to Europe, but this accusation was never
substantiated.
