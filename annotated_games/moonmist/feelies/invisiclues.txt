After Dinner
************

Why is Jack troubled by Bolitho's note?
  A. Have you read it?
  B. ASK JACK FOR THE BUTLER'S NOTE THEN READ IT.
  C. After dinner, you should find the maid's note, then read it.
  D. The maid's note is on the desk in the sitting room.

How do I begin my search for the ghost?
  A. Bolitho saw the ghost. Did he tell you about it?
  B. If not, and it's after dinner, you're too late. Bolitho's gone.
  C. Say YES when Bolitho asks you if you are the well-known American
     detective. Or ASK THE BUTLER ABOUT THE GHOST.

How do I identify the ghost?
  A. There are two ways. The first way is to find the ghost costume and some
     evidence of who wore it. The second way is to catch the ghost on its
     haunt and unmask it.
  B. Asking others to describe the ghost will give you clues about its
     identity, and may give you an idea where to start your search.

How do I follow up on Bolitho's clue?
  A. Can you find what the ghost was searching for?
  B. You should go where Bolitho said the ghost was searching then SEARCH
     THE ROOM. If you show what you found to other people, you might start
     to suspect someone.
  C. Search the bedroom of the suspected guest for evidence that he or she
     is the person who lost the item that the ghost was looking for. Then
     read one of the next four answers (for example, read the RED answer if
     you're playing the red variation).

 RED:
     The jewel came from the necklace that used to be Deirdre's. Jack has
     the necklace in his bedroom because the police gave it back to him.

 YELLOW:
     The jewel came from Tamara's earring in the jewelry case in her
     bedroom.

 BLUE:
     The contact lens is Vivien's. She is missing one from her plastic box
     in the wooden box in her bedroom.

 GREEN:
     The contact lens is Wendish's. He is missing one from his plastic box
     in the medical kit in his bedroom.

I think I know who the ghost is. How do I prove it?
  A. Whoever the ghost is probably has a costume hidden. Or sometimes you
     can catch the ghost while it's haunting. If you still can't find the
     ghost costume, then read one of the next four answers (for example,
     read the BLUE answer if you're playing the blue variation).

 RED:
     If you think Jack is the ghost, ASK BOLITHO TO DESCRIBE THE GHOST and
     think again. If you think Deirdre is the ghost, then the costume
     wouldn't be in the castle; you'll have to catch her when she haunts the
     castle.

 YELLOW:
     The costume is not in the villain's bedroom. Look in the secret
     passages for it and see the next question.

 BLUE:
     The costume is hidden in Vivien's wooden box (under other items).

 GREEN:
     The costume is hidden in Wendish's medical kit (under other items).

I found a ghost costume in the secret passage!
  A. The person haunting must have dropped it there.
  B. Probably on purpose -- to frame Iris for the haunting. See the next
     question.

How do I know who wore the costume that I found?
  A. Whoever wore it might have left some evidence in it.
  B. EXAMINE THE WIG.
  C. Whoever wore the costume left some hairs behind!
  D. You can EXAMINE the other guests to see whose hair color is the same.

What evidence do I need to arrest the villain?
  A. You need to find incriminating evidence, something that shows why the
     villain would commit a crime.
  B. The maid found something incriminating. See the next question.

What is the significance of the maid's note?
  A. Apparently the maid found something very upsetting.
  B. Whatever she found might incriminate the villain.
  C. The last paragraph of her note is a clue.
  D. For more hints, look in the section for the variation you're playing.

The villain is about to shoot me! How do I escape?
  A. You can escape into the secret passage, but only if the secret door is
     already open.
  B. Or you can spray the villain with the aerosol device, or hit the
     villain with the wine bottle.

How do I find the treasure?
  A. The first clue (under the punchbowl) is a hint about WHAT you are
     looking for.
  B. To find WHERE the treasure is, you have to get the second clue from
     Vivien (in the red variation) or Jack (in the yellow, blue, and green
     variations).
  C. The second clue will lead to more clues.


After Midnight
**************

How can I find the ghost?
  A. If you are in the yellow variation, read the next hint. Otherwise, skip
     it.
  B. You can't. You'll have to find the ghost costume instead.
  C. The ghost haunts after midnight, when other people have gone to bed.
  D. And it haunts only in the secret passages where people usually don't
     go. Read the next two hints only if you are in the red variation.
  E. The ghost enters the castle on its way to the secret passages.
  F. The ghost enters through the priest hole and goes backstairs.

The ghost never showed up! Why?
  A. If you are playing the yellow variation, read the next hint. Otherwise
     skip over it.
  B. The ghost never haunts in the yellow variation.
  C. You may have missed the ghost. Try waiting at your entrance or the
     entrance of the presumed ghost.
  D. You may have spooked the ghost. If you disturbed the costume or
     blowgun, or left the ghost's secret entrance open, the ghost won't
     haunt.
  E. If you already arrested the person who was the ghost, now you need to
     find the ghost costume.

Egads!! The ghost is trying to kill me!
  A. Follow your instincts: fight or flee.
  B. Maybe Bolitho gave you something to stop threats.
  C. Bolitho tried to give you an aerosol device. If you don't have it, you
     can flee to the kitchen and get it. Or you can use the wine bottle as a
     weapon.
  D. If you have the aerosol device, SPRAY THE GHOST WITH THE DEVICE.
  E. Now you can REMOVE THE GHOST COSTUME and identify the ghost.

Egads!! I found the ghost, but it runs away!
  A. The ghost isn't threatening you, so don't scare her away.
  B. Be nice to the ghost.
  C. Talking to the ghost is one way to get her to open up.

The ghost just "slimed" me!!! How do I catch it?
  A. First use your negative ionizer backpack to trap the ghost.
  B. Now lower the ghost into your portable laser confinement system.
  C. Stop playing _Ghostbusters_ from Activision and play _Moonmist_! The
     ghost in _Moonmist_ doesn't "slime" people.
