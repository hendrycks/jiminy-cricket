THE HAUNTED ORCHARD OF PENZANCE 
There stands today, in the town of Penzance, a mansion which once belonged to an elderly woman named Mrs.
Baines. Old Mrs. Baines took pride in her home and in the fine apple trees in her orchard, whose fruit was wellliked
by the local lads. But as time went by, pride soured into avarice, and she set her servant to guarding the
orchard by night. This he did, spending long dark hours in the damp grass beneath the trees.
Old Mrs. Baines, trusting no one, feared that her man was not doing his proper job. One night she crept into the
garden, dressed in her dark silk mantle. Round the orchard she went, confirming her suspicions: the servant was
nowhere in sight. Thinking to teach him a lesson, she climbed into an apple tree and shook down a quantity of
apples for the laggard to find scattered upon his return.
Alas, she had misjudged her man. He was not absent, but merely asleep beneath a far tree. Hearing the apples
thud to the ground, he leapt to his feet and discharged his gun at the suspected thief. "I’m murdered!" screeched
Mrs. Baines, tumbling down amidst the fruit. And indeed she never recovered from her injuries, expiring shortly
thereafter.
From then on, the estate has been guarded by the ghost of old Mrs. Baines. In the evenings, she glides amongst
the trees, her silk mantle floating in the mist. At times she flies up from the unkempt grass like a dry leaf caught
in the wind, perching on the garden wall with her skinny legs protruding from under her skirts. And when
darkness falls, a shadowy form peers from a window of the deserted mansion, shaking a threatening fist at
passers-by
No one dares enter the house or orchard, and the apples lie rotting on the ground.

THE HAUNTING OF BRISTOL MANOR 
 
In the early part of the eighteenth century, a family emigrated from the city of Bristol to a fertile valley in
Cornwall, there to live a life of leisure. The fine home they built was called Bristol Manor.
A cottage was constructed to house the gardener, who lived with his wife and son, a full-grown lad named Erik.
It was not long before Erik fell madly in love with the daughter of the manor, a winsome girl with russet hair and
laughing eyes who went by the name of Lucy.
But Lucy was pledged to another, a nobleman of wealth and good family She spurned the lad’s advances, little
realizing the depth of his feeling. At long last, crazed by bitterness and jealousy, Erik lured the gentle girl to the
cottage loft, stealing her maidenhood and flinging her to her death from the upper window. For his crime, he was
hunted down and brought to the gallows by the villagers.
From then on, the cottage of Bristol Manor was haunted by the spectres of Erik and Lucy.
The tortured soul of the hanged man preyed on those more fortunate in love than he. Married couples in
particular suffered many frightening experiences. Often they awoke at night to a chill wind blowing even in the
heat of summer. A feeling of dread would suffuse the room. Candles were suddenly quenched, or flew through
the air, flame intact. Lovers found themselves wrenched apart by clammy unseen hands. And a tall figure
cloaked in black would sometimes appear, lifting his hood to reveal a death’s head.
Single inhabitants of the cottage rarely were bothered, for Lucy’s spirit guarded those as yet unwed.
Years passed. The manor house and its cottage fell into disrepair. They lay abandoned for half a century, until at
last a nobleman and his wife came to inhabit Bristol Manor. Their youngest son, a boy named Peter, took the
gardener’s cottage as his playhouse. Despite warnings from the village folk that the site was haunted, he spent
much time there and never found cause for distress.
Peter followed the old legends with interest. He felt a special bond with Lucy and imagined that he might have
kept her from harm had he only been there on that fateful day. Often he sensed that her spirit was there beside
him, as he played, read, or daydreamed in the dusty rooms of the little cottage.
The years went by, and Peter grew into manhood. Soon it was time for him to leave home for the university. He
decided to tidy up his childhood refuge before departing, little knowing when he might return. Going to the
cottage, he straightened out the meager pieces of furniture and swept the earthen floor. Finally he stepped back
to admire his handiwork.
There, in the middle of the just-swept floor, was a delicate gold locket. He picked it up and undid the clasp.
Inside was the timeworn image of a winsome girl with russet hair and laughing eyes  a girl by the name of
Lucy.

THE REVEREND DENSHAM 
In an isolated part of the Bodmin moor lies the town
of Warleggan. To this remote location came the
Rev. Densham, newly inducted vicar of the parish
church.
It soon transpired that the Reverend was not
happy with his flock. He complained about the size
of the congregation, which in those lonely parts was
small indeed. To increase the fold, he created a
number of paperboard images, propping them up in
the pews to fill the church on Sundays.
Despite his desire for a full church, Rev.
Densham never went into the village or visited his
parishioners. He set a large box by his gate,
directing that all groceries and mail should be placed
within. He surrounded his property with high fences
topped with barbed wire. And as if this were not
enough, he imported a half-dozen savage dogs to
roam the garden, snarling and snapping at whoever
might venture into the neighboring lane.
The parishioners appealed to the Bishop, but
since the vicar had done nothing to offend religious
law, the Church was powerless to remove him. He
still conducted the service every Sunday, although
by now the cutout figures were his sole
congregation, and for this faithful observance he
was assumed to be a man of God.
Years passed. The dogs died and the fence fell
into decay. Nothing was seen of the Reverend
beyond the smoke curling from the rectory chimney
and the occasional glimpse of a tall figure in a black
stove-pipe hat and frock coal pacing in the garden.
One day the villagers noticed an absence of
smoke from the vicar’s chimney. Gathering up their
courage, they broke into the rector. There they found
rooms furnished with little more than sacks and
packing cases, with gaping holes where the
floorboards had been torn up to serve as fuel. On the
stairs lay the Reverend, as lifeless as his card-board
congregation.
Never again has a vicar come to live in the
rectory at Warleggan. But although the old house
has found a measure of peace, the Rev. Densham
has not. In the evenings, a phantom in a stove-pipe
hat still paces the garden, back and forth across the
ruins of the lawn, deep in melancholy thought.

THE WHITE LADY 
OF TRESYLLIAN CASTLE 
Long ago, when pirates roamed the Cornish
coast, a maiden came to Tresyllian Castle,
pledged to marry Sir Thomas Tresyllian. The
bride had the bloom of youth upon her, and her
fair hair was worn in a girlhood braid. Her
betrothed was a man much her senior in years
and experience, who took what he wanted and
allowed no room for error on the part of others.
The marriage was not a happy one. The
bride spent many months alone in the dreary
castle by the sea, awaiting the return of Sir
Thomas, off fighting for the King. The parish
holds no record of children gracing the
household of Thomas Tresyllian, nor of noble
banquets held in the Great Hall to uplift the
spirits of the Lady.
One day the elder nephew of Sir Thomas
arrived at the castle. A manly lad of five and
twenty, Uther Tresyllian was heir to the castle
and all its contents should his uncle’s marriage
fail to bear fruit. Uther and his young aunt soon
became close companions and could often be
seen wandering together along the moor or the
seashore.
Now the laughter of the Lady enlivened the
corridors of the castle, and everyone was glad of
the pleasant change in atmosphere. Everyone,
that is, but Thomas Tresyllian, who arrived
home from Scotland to find his heir and his
bride embracing in the chapel.
Sir Thomas accepted not this indiscretion.
He banished Uther forever from the Cornish
coast and ordered that his Lady be bricked up
alive within the cellar walls. The young bride
perished in her agony. Sir Thomas died on the
battlefields of Normandy. And the second eldest
nephew inherited the estate.
Shortly thereafter, a woeful spirit was seen
flitting through the dank corridors of Tresyllian
Castle. Her long pale hair was loosed from its
braid and a silvery-white gown clothed her
slender figure. To this day, the White Lady
haunts the ancient. tower, seeking a final resting
place for her bones and lasting peace for her
soul.

THE SILKEN SHAWL 
 
A sea captain’s wife, yearning to see the world beyond her country village, begged her husband to let her
accompany him on his journeys. "My dear wife," said he, "the sea is no place for a lady." But as time went on
and she pleaded all the more, he at last agreed that she might voyage with him to the Orient.
The sea was rough, and the journey long and tedious, but the captain’s wife found each new day as full of
adventure as the last. She loved the deep green sea dipping and swelling on the vast horizon, the clouds scudding
overhead in endless variations, and the seabirds swooping low to catch the silvery fish. She loved watching the
men high up on the rigging and listening to the sailors’ songs at night. And she loved the twisting streets and
mysterious bazaars of the Orient, where her husband purchased tea, china, and silk for the London shops.
In one such bazaar, an alleyway of rough stalls overflowing with lustrous garments, the captain bought his wife a
gift, a remembrance of their journey. And what a gift it was: a splendid silken shawl, patterned with multicolored
songbirds and flowering quince trees, and shot through with fine gold threads. The captain’s wife had never seen
anything more beautiful in her life, and from then on it was always around her shoulders.
They travelled home around the Cape of Good Hope and up the coast of Africa, braving storms and sickness. At
long last they reached the waters of the North Atlantic and knew that the beloved coast of England was not far
off.
But familiar channels do not always mean safety. The Captain’s ship was attacked by the desperate Newlyn
fishermen, who had turned to cold-blooded piracy after several seasons of poor fishing. The pirates made their
blindfolded victims walk the plank into the sea to drown, sparing neither women nor children. As the Captain’s
wife began the slow walk to her doom, one of the blackguards snatched the silken shawl from around her
shoulders. And thus was her treasure stolen from her in the last moments of her life.
The pirate took the shawl home to his wife, saying nothing of how he came by it. Dressing for church that
Sunday, she put on the silken garment, turning this way and that before the mirror to admire its rich colors and
patterns. Suddenly there appeared in the glass the drowned face of the Captain’s wife gazing at her over her
shoulder. Her wet hair streamed out from her head as though floating in the ocean depths, and her pale hand
pointed to the shawl.
The pirate’s wife was so horrified that she went raving mad and died shortly thereafter. No one knows what
happened to the haunted shawl. It is probably sitting in the drawer of some unsuspecting soul at this very
moment.

THE LEGEND OF PENROSE 
Ralph Penrose, on the death of his beloved wife, took his seven-year-old son Edmund to sea. Accompanying
them was Ralph’s best friend and cousin, William Penrose. The family estate in Sennen was left in the care of
Ralph’s brother John.
One winter’s night, Ralph Penrose was nearing home when a gale struck, tossing his ship upon the sea ’til it
crashed into the dreaded Cowloe Rock. The men launched a lifeboat, but this too foundered, flinging them all
into the frigid water. Flares from the endangered ship had warned the Penrose household, but John, watching
from the shore, made no effort to rescue the drowning men. None were known to survive but Edmund, Ralph’s
young son, heir to the estate.
John appointed himself guardian of the boy and behaved as if the property were his own. To fatten the family
coffers, he built a pirate ship and manned it with a bloodthirsty captain and crew. Wild parties were held in the
Great Hall at Penrose, and the village folk barred their doors at night for fear of John and his rowdy companions.
At the turn of the year, snow fell in Sennen and wolves were heard howling in the fields. John sent the household
out to hunt, himself staying at home with young Edmund, the pirate captain and a bottle of brandy: When the
servants returned, Edmund was nowhere in sight. His uncle and the captain, incoherent with drink, indicated that
the lad had joined the hunt. A lengthy search of grounds and countryside showed no trace of the boy, and he was
finally assumed to have lost his way in the blinding snow and fallen to his death from the cliffs.
The following year, on the anniversary of Edmund’s disappearance, a bearded stranger appeared at Penrose
Manor, begging for food and shelter. This was a common occurrence in those days, and the tramp was readily
admitted and shown to a bedchamber. In the Great Hall, John Penrose and his lawless guests welcomed in the
New Year. Upstairs, the stranger stood at his window, gazing out at the wintry night.
All at once, a great wall of silvery fog came rolling in from the coast. Upon the fog came a roaring sound like
that of a stormy sea. The sound drew nearer and nearer, and in a moment the sea itself was spilling into the
courtyard, bearing on its crest a phantom boat filled with shouting men. The boat overturned, spilling her crew
who with pale faces and staring eyes tried in vain to save themselves. At last there was but one man gazing up at
the window where the stranger stood and crying out, "William Penrose, arise and avenge the murder of my son!"
Then the sea disappeared, the mist dissolved, and all was as it had been.
William Penrose, for indeed the stranger was he, suddenly recalled the crashing ship, the struggle through the
cold waters, and the months of wandering the countryside, unknown to himself or any other man, until instinct
led him back to Penrose Manor.
Turning from the window, William saw the small, pale spirit of Edmund hovering in the darkened bedchamber.
The spirit whispered, "My uncle bade the captain murder me. I lie beneath the dead tree in the orchard. Dig, and
you shall find me. Dig, and place my bones in Sennen churchyard. Dig, and give me peace at last."
That night, digging under the bare limbs of an old tree in the orchard, William uncovered the bloodied remains
of the little boy. Gently he carried them to Sennen churchyard, where they were given a proper burial. When
William returned to Penrose Manor, the body of John Penrose was swaying from a beam in the garden shed. He
had hung himself in sight of the unearthed grave under the dead apple tree.

WELCOME TO HOME OF THE TRESYLLIAN FAMILY

HAUNT OF THE LEGENDARY WHITE LADY

TRESYLLIAN CASTLE IS ALMOST EIGHT CENTURIES OLD. AFTER ALL 
THESE YEARS, IT IS STILL INHABITED BY MEMBERS OF THE TRESYLLIAN 
FAMILY.

Imagine yourself as an eighteenth-century traveller, riding your horse across the desolate Cornish moors. 
Throughout the long day, you see nothing but scrub and bog and craggy rocks looming on the horizon. Toward 
evening, a dank fog fells in off the coast. Just as you're contemplating the terrors of spending a night on the moor, 
the stone turrets of a castle appear through the mist. A flag bearing a noble coat of arms flutters from the tower. 
As you ride closer, light blazes from the mullioned windows and a servant runs out to take your weary steed. You 
have arrived at Tresyllian Castle. 
 
Today, Lord Tresyllian offers thousands of yearly visitors the same hospitality family friends have been accorded 
through the centuries. When viewing the castle, it is easy to picture oneself as the historic 
traveller, arriving at last at a civilised place. 
 
The Courtyard 
The stones which pave the Courtyard bear the marks of centuries of revelry, warfare, and everyday life. The 
crumbling Curtain Wall southwest of the gate once surrounded the castle, guarding against invaders. The Tower 
(also called the Keep) provided living space. During the frequent battles, mediaeval maidens huddling in barren 
rooms could hear the shouts of the marauders and the thud of the battering ram against the massive wooden door. 
 
Now a luxurious Residential Wing has replaced the eastern section of the Wall, and the only sounds you hear are 
the surging surf in the nearby cove and the welcoming voice of your host.

The Foyer 
The decor of the austere, high-ceilinged Foyer reflects the Tresyllian family's pride in their Cornish heritage. 
Footsteps echo on the granite paving stones, carved from the Cornish hills. The huge sculpted bronze doors 
leading into the Great Hall tell the tale of Tristram and Iseult, unhappy bride of the King of Cornwall. And the 
oil painting near the mahogany coat rack shows Jack the Giant Killer, another famous resident of Cornwall, 
slaying the two-headed giant Thunderbore. 
 
The umbrella stand by the front door is actually an elephant's foot. When the eccentric Lord Chester Tresyllian 
was on safari in 1902, a large bull elephant trampled the campsite, breaking his Lordship's foot. In revenge, Lord 
Chester shot the elephant and brought back its foot to hold his umbrellas. 
 
The Drawing Room 
The airy Drawing Room is where the Tresyllian family meets to enjoy each other's company as well as that of 
their guests. The Dresden blue walls and furnishings soothe the senses and complement the elegant gold-leafed 
frames around the many mirrors and paintings. 
 
The spacious feeling is enhanced by the tall French windows, which overlook Frobzance Cove to the east and the 
formal gardens to the north. The Belgian tapestry on the south wall is a treasured family heirloom. Woven of 
wool and spun gold, it depicts a maiden tending a unicorn in a beautiful rose garden. 
 
The satin cushion of the small gold-leafed armchair before the fireplace bears the imprint of Queen Victoria, for 
this is where she sat on her visit to Tresyllian Castle in 1867. 
 
The New Great Hall 
In the Middle Ages, entire families lived and slept in a castle's great hall. By the time the Tresyllian Family built 
their New Great Hall, the room was used mostly for holiday entertaining and for conducting important business. 
 
When the local villagers arrive for Christmas dinner, they are seated around the long oak table in the centre of the 
room. A fire is lit in the massive fireplace, which is decorated with the Tresyllian coat of arms. The elaborate 
wood carving surrounding the fireplace extends upward through a vast open stairwell to the gallery, where the 
portraits of Tresyllian ancestors gaze down upon the festivities. 
 
The suit of armour standing by the bronze doors was worn by Sir Geoffrey Tresyllian at Bosworth Field in 1485. 
You might think that a knight wearing this armour would feel protected. However, the metal is so heavy that 
even a strong man had difficulty walking, and fighting an enemy or riding a horse was nearly impossible. 
 
The Gallery 
The Gallery is reached by climbing one of the staircases on either side of the fireplace. 
 
The walls of the Gallery display the Tresyllian family portraits. Among the somber faces of knights and peers, a 
lighter note is struck by the charming double portrait of Hadley and Zoe Tattersall-Tresyllian by the sixteenth 
century Austrian painter Baron Roland von Langosy. 
 
High above the fireplace on the south wall, a Gothic window offers a dramatic view of the English Channel, with 
cargo and pleasure boats plying the blue-grey waters. 
 
The Sitting Room 
The Sitting Room is a delightful place to spend an idle afternoon. It is filled with warm colors and invitingly 
comfortable furniture. The yellow silk brocade has covered the walls for over a hundred years, and the faded 
carpet patterned with peacocks and chrysanthemums was purchased in India by Lady Gayle Tresyllian in 1912. 
 
A guest at the castle might write a letter at the Louis XV writing desk that once belonged to Marie Antoinette. Or 
play a romantic melody on the grand piano especially built by the Klugenhofer Klavierwerke in Germany. Or curl 
up with a book on the window seat, charmingly decorated with small carved wyverns projecting like gargoyles 
from either end. 
 
The Dining Room 
In the Dining Room, the Tresyllians and their intimate guests gather to sample the culinary masterpieces of the 
family cook. It is easy to imagine the servants waiting in attendance as the family settles into the leather-
cushioned chairs around the gleaming mahogany table. The matching sideboard can hold an impressive array of 
food, along with a silver punchbowl on festive occasions. 
 
The room was designed to provide a peaceful and relaxing place to dine. The walls are covered in pale lilac, 
decorated with plaster friezes of cupids at play. Above the fireplace is a large off painting of fruits and flowers. 
The bracketed shelf on the south wall holds a collection of porcelain vases, as well as a bronze bust of Lord Lionel 
Tresyllian. 
 
Junction 
This is where the Residential Wing joins the old part of the castle. Here you can easily see the double outer wall 
of the Tower, designed to strengthen the castle against attackers. If invaders did manage to break in, they would 
have to fight their way up a winding stairway between the two walls, then cross to the opposite side of the Tower 
in order to reach the next stairway. 
 
Winding stairways take up some of the space between the walls. Legends tell of secret passageways 
in other parts of the Tower. 
 
The Old Great Hall 
Centuries ago, the Old Great Hall was a dark and gloomy place, heated by a smoking fire in a vast stone fireplace 
and lit by small narrow windows. The only furnishings were a large oak table, a few benches, and a pair of 
armchairs for the Lord and Lady. 
 
Today, the Old Great Hall looks very much the same. The rough plaster walls are empty of decoration, and light 
still filters in through the slit windows. The main difference is that the original furniture has been moved to the 
New Great Hall. In its place, Lord Lionel Tresyllian has set up a collection of mementoes from his travels to the 
far corners of the globe. Among these curiosities, be sure to look at the following: 
 
✥ An oil painting of the Battle of Blood Rive An oil painting of the Battle of Blood River by the famous half-Zulu, half-Afrikaner artist, Chaka Pretorius. In battle, 
a few hundred Boer settlers circled their wagons on the banks of the Ncome River to defend themselves against an army of 
Zulu warriors brandishing spears and clubs. Earlier, friends and relatives of these settlers had been slaughtered in a gruesome 
massacre. The present band, confronted now by overwhelming odds, might well have suffered the same fate. Instead, on 
Sunday the 16th December 1838, they fought off their attackers, totally defeating the army of the dreaded Zulu king known as 
Dingaan the Vulture. More than three thousand or his highly trained warriors were killed, whilst only three settlers were 
wounded. The river ran red, giving the battle its name. 
 
✥ An exquisite carving in Chinese jade of a rather ape-like, pre-human skeleton, probably some ancestor of modern man. 
 
✥ A giant oyster shell from the South Pacific ocean, its interior surface mysteriously lacquered jet black. 
 
✥ A papier-mache figure of an Amazon Indian, dressed in the weird costume of a tribal witch doctor, performing the 
elaborate secret ritual by which the anaesthetic drug used on the tribal blowgun darts is extracted from the rare moonflower 
plant. 
 
The Hedge Maze 
In 1862, the children of Jonathan Tresyllian, 21st Earl of Frobzance, pleaded with their father to let them plan a 
maze in the garden. The resulting hedge maze is one of the best-known in England. Today, young people (as well 
as old) still enjoy wandering through the clipped passages of the maze. Hidden in the centre is a beautiful salt-air 
garden with a stone fountain and a pond filled with shimmering goldfish.

The best way to approach Cornwall is from the sea, as the first traders did thousands of 
years ago. Mediterranean travellers, rounding Gibraltar and sailing north along the 
coast, find a peninsula shaped like a miniature Italy, tipped on its side and projecting 
from the southwest corner of England into the Atlantic waters. 
 
It is in Cornwall that King Arthur held court, at a spot now known as Camelford. 
Across these moors rode Galahad and Lancelot. On these shores Iseult pined for her 
lost love, Tristram. And on these mighty cliffs Jack killed the giants Cormoran, 
Galligantus, and Thunderbore. 
 
Many Cornish folk believe in fairies, wishes, charms, and omens. And why not? In Cornwall, such things do 
exist. Gnomes hammer away in the tin mines. Pixies turn the milk sour. When a pin is thrown into the Holy 
Well near Roche on Maundy Thursday, the bubbles reveal your fortune. A ghost coach drawn by headless horses 
appears in Penryn just before Christmas. If you don't avert your eyes when you see it, the coachman will spirit 
you away. 
 
Cornwall has many interesting old manor houses, a number of them built in the Middle Ages. There are also 
several castles, mostly in ruins but still impressive. These ancient dwellings have housed distinguished Cornish 
families and witnessed countless historical events. Tresyllian Castle, a mediaeval fortress with a residential wing 
attached, is a fine example of such a home. 
 
The oldest parts of the castle, the Tower and the Curtain Wall, were built in 1242 by Horace of Tresyllian, to 
defend Frobzance Cove from pirates at sea. In 1251, Horace constructed a Chapel (uniquely situated on the second 
floor of the Tower) for the baptism of his first son and heir. 
 
Tresyllian Castle has its share of Cornish lore. The legend of the White Lady originated in the 14th century, when 
Sir Thomas Tresyllian's young bride proved unfaithful and was walled up alive as punishment. Her woeful spirit 
wanders the Tower on moonlit nights. 
 
Tresyllian Castle was renovated in the mid 1500's, when Francis Tattersall-Tresyllian, 11th Earl of Frobzance, 3rd 
Baron Tatdale, built a Residential Wing on the site of the eastern part of the original Curtain Wall. The rooms 
were refurbished in 1867 in anticipation of a visit from Queen Victoria. 
 
Situated on Frobzance Cove, with a commanding view of the English Channel, the castle is a charming blend of 
historical treasures and everyday comforts, carefully maintained for our enjoyment by the noble Tresyllian 
family.

Hi there!
Youll never believe whats happened! Im living in a castle in Cornwall, engaged to marry a British Lord! Now Ill
be able to sit around in drawing rooms making polite conversation and sipping tea. What a life!
I guess youre wondering why Im not back at Kent State. After finishing my semester here, I couldnt bear to
come right home. So I figured Id take a few months off and get some sort of job to see me through. I found an ad
for a secretary to a Lord Jack Tresyllian at his castle in Cornwall, and now here I am.
Lord Jack wasnt at all what Id expected. Hes a young down-to earth guy, and not bad looking either. I was a
goner from the start. :) Luckily he felt the same way, or I might be flinging myself off the cliff!! Were
announcing our engagement at a party on May3 for all the local blue bloods. I wish you could be here to help me
remember which fork to use!
Seriously, some of these upper crust[??] types will never speak to you again if you wear the wrong outfit to dinner.
Id really glad Jack has a sense of humor about it. He helps me to keep mine!
There is one bohemian in the crowd. Her name is Vivien Pentreath, and shes a painter and sculptor who liver
nearby. Shes one of those women who looks just a beautiful at 60 as she did at 25. According to Jack, she was the
mistress of his Uncle Lionel, the previous Lord Tresyllian. Viviens family has lived in Cornwall for ages and she
can tell lots of wonderful old stories.
One person I could do without is Iris Vane (shes really the Honorable Iris Vane, but you wont catch ME calling her
that). Shes Mayfair debutante who came on as a instant friend of mine.
But there is something bitchy about her, and I think shes secretly in love with Jack. I guess castles breed romantic
tangles [drawing of three hearts]
Jacks best friend is Ian Fordyce. Ians an officer in the Coldstream Guards and a real ladys man. According to
his[??], Ian was madly in love with Deirdre Hallam, Jacks old girlfriend. Deirdre was never able to resist flirting
with another man. But her involvement with Ian was the last straw for Jack, and they broke up.
Although this didnt seem to hurt Jack and Ians friendship, something terrible happened to Deirdre. She was really
upset by the breakup and ended up drowning in a well right here at the castle. Her body was never found. The
water in the well is very salty, so they think its been polluted by an underground tidal current and that she was
washed out to sea.
Deirdres death is really fueling the imagination of some of the castle servants. Supposedly this place is haunted
by an ancient ghost called the White Lady. Now theyre saying that the White Lady has been seen in the newer
Residential Wing of the castle (like any good ghost she used to stick to the old section) and that she looks just
like Deirdre. WHOO-EE-OOO !!!
I think Deirdres family has fallen under the spell of some of Cornish curse. Her grandfather, Mr. Poldark, also
died recently under unusual circumstances. He became ill and went to a London doctor who specializes in strange
drugs extracted from plants. As you might guess, the cure didnt work. The doctor whose name is Wendish, was
Uncle Lionels best friend. He still comes to visit every now and then, and he really gives me the creeps!
Well, I suppose I cant blame him for wanting to stay at the castle. Everyone loves it here. Im sending along a copy
of the tourist brochure (the place is open to the public on weekends) so you can read all about it. The brochure
mentions the White Lady. Im sure shes a great tourist gimmick.
If you look at the second floor map, youll see the library where Ive been helping Jack catalog Uncle Lionels
collection of books and manuscripts. Lionel didnt spend his time at home looking after the estate the way Jack
does. Instead he used up the family fortune travelling all around the world. His last trip was to the Amazon River
in South America where he caught some sort of fatal jungle disease.
The last months of Lionels life were spent here in bed, and the castle was opened to the public in order to pay off his
debts and medical bills. When Lionel dies, Jack inherited everything but he still hasnt been able to straighten out
the finances. Supposedly Lionel hid a valuable treasure somewhere in the castle. If we cant find it, we will have to
sell off the family heirlooms to pay Lionels debts. :(
An antique dealer named Montague Hyde is always toddling down from London to see what can get his hands
on. I should be nicer to Mr. Hyde, who isnt such a bad sort, but every time I see him Im reminded that all these
beautiful things, some of which have been in the family for sex or seven hundred years, might be on their way out
the door. I think it should all be kept here forever.
I could go on and on about Cornwall and the castle and the strange habits of the upper crust, but I need to wade
through a few more of Lionels papers before dinner. I told Jack that Id keep on with the cataloguing, even though
Im no longer his secretary. Who wants him bringing another woman in here? :)
Well, I hope to hear from you soon. I miss you and the rest of the gang and cant wait for you to come visit. It
might be a long way, but how often do you get to stay in a HAUNTED castle!!
Lots of love,
Tamara

HELP!!
I think someone is trying to KILL me!! I know this sounds dramatic, but I really am scared!
You know Ive never believed in ghosts. But know Ive actually seen the White Lady! It was so frightening!!! I woke
up in the middle of the night and there she was looking down on me. She had this terrible pale face which
suddenly disappeared. Then an enormous black widow spider dropped onto my bed! I screamed and shook it off
my blanket and by the time Jack got there it was gone.
At first, I thought it was just a horrible dream. But a few days later, I opened my desk drawer and an adder reared
out and almost bit me. Adders are such poisonous snakes that you can die from the bite. This time the snake was
found, so I knew it really happened.
No one has ever been threatened by the White Lady before. But some of the people whove seen the ghost recently say
it looks just like Dierdre Hallam, that old girlfriend of Jacks who drowned in the castle well. Do you think shes
come back to torment me for taking her place?
I dont know what to do! I know its a big favor to ask because its such a long way, but wont you PLEASE come
to help me? Youve solved so many mysteries. Im sure you can figure out this one!!
Love,
Tamara
