For Your Amusement


The Ship
********

Good Gracious! What is this extremely improper scene at the very beginning?
  A. You are asleep, dreaming this when the pirates attack.
  B. It's a preview of things to come.
  C. It's a sample of the writing style of _Plundered Hearts_.
  D. Romance novels always have teasers of this sort.

Pirates are attacking _Lafond Deux_! What can I do?
  A. You don't need to do anything, actually, though you may like to whack
     an occasional pirate over the head with something. Heroines always get
     rescued from ticklish situations like this one.  Well, almost always.

I'm stuck in the Captain's Quarters! How can I escape?
  A. There are two ways to escape, actually. One to the fore and one abaft.
  B. Have you looked behind the curtain?
  C. The cupboard isn't quite blocking the doorway.
  D. To go to the fore, type WALK FORWARD. If Captain Jamison is present, he
     won't let you go, of course.
  E. To go aft, see the next question ("How do I get on deck?").

How do I get on deck?
  A. The hatch is closed tight and the door is barred, so you'll have to
     find some other way.
  B. You need to climb the rope ladder that appears when Jamison leaves the
     ship.
  C. The window won't open, but there's another way to "open" it.
  D. THROW THE COFFER AT THE WINDOW.
  E. Having broken the window, you can't reach the ladder without getting on
     the ledge first. SIT ON THE LEDGE.
  F. All you need do is TAKE THE LADDER. Then you'll have to climb it
     quickly. You can't hang onto slimy hemp forever.
  G. With practice, climbing this ladder becomes much easier. In fact,
     after you've done it once, a simple CLIMB UP and CLIMB DOWN will
     suffice.

I can't climb the ladder! My skirts get in the way!
  A. Climb on to the ledge again, remove your dress and start the process
     over. This is no time for modesty.

Immodest I must be to get on deck, but I cannot, so undressed, preserve my
virtue from Jamison's lusty crew. How may I move around?
  A. Is there some way to disguise your gender?
  B. Have you thoroughly examined the sleeping cupboard in the landing?
  C. Opened it? Climbed into it? Examined the pile of clothes in it?
  D. If you wear the shirt and breeches as a disguise, the pirates won't
     bother you.

How can I prevent the ship from blowing up?
  A. You need to get on deck first.
  B. Did you notice, in the hold, the fuse burning towards the kegs of
     gunpowder, behind the fence?
  C. Since you can't get through the fence yourself, you have to discover
     some way of putting the fuse out from a distance.
  D. The gap above the fence will help.
  E. You can throw things over the fence on to the burning end of the fuse.
  F. They just slide off, you say, leaving the fuse undoused? What best
     fights fire?
  G. Water! But since you can't move the water barrel from the deck, you'll
     have to rip off some other solution.
  H. Getting ragged thinking about this?
  I. RIP THE FROCK to make a rag. Then SOAK THE RAG IN THE WATER.
  J. Finally, THROW THE WET RAG AT THE FUSE.

How can I stop the _Helena Louise_ from dashing on the rocks?
  A. You need to get on deck first.
  B. You may have overheard Crulley committing some mischief on the deck
     above the crew's quarters. That's the forecastle.
  C. Have you gone north from the forecastle to the bowsprit?
  D. One of the two anchor lines has been cut. The ship is drifting on the
     tide.
  E. You'll have to lower another anchor. Know what a mooring winch is?
  F. Examine the lever on the winch.
  G. To open the teeth on the winch, in order to release the main anchor,
     RAISE THE LEVER.

How can I rescue my father, trapped as I am aboard the _Helena Louise_?
  A. To escape the ship, you need to get on deck first.
  B. Have you examined the pyramid of casks on the quarterdeck?
  C. One of the casks is open ended.
  D. If you enter the cask, you will notice...
  E. A fraying rope. Maybe if you just helped it along a little.
  F. There's a dagger in the Galley.
  G. ENTER THE CASK. CUT THE ROPE WITH THE DAGGER.

I escape the ship but drift out to sea. How can I get ashore?
  A. The tide is going out. Wait for the tide to change.
  B. While you're waiting for the tide to change, you might want to stop the
     _Helena Louise_ from dashing against the reefs.

Of what use is the skiff?
  A. You never HAVE to use it, it is just there in case you want to go back
     to the _Helena Louise_...
  B. To get items you forgot to bring along...
  C. To go back to save the ship from exploding.


The Mansion
***********

How can I get into the mansion?
  A. There are five routes into the house, two from the western side and one
     from every other direction.
  B. The easterly entrance is approached from the Folly. See the question
     about the slat in the folly for more information. ("There is a loose
     slat at the back of the folly. Is it important?")
  C. One of the western entrances is from the Trade Entrance, into the
     kitchen. See the next question for more information. ("Who is this
     woman who keeps throwing me out of the kitchen?")
  D. Another is from the Clearing northeast of the Forest. The place with
     the climbing vines.
  E. When you climb the vine in the clearing, you'll find your way into an
     upstairs room.
  F. The northerly entrance is south from the Main Entrance. You'll need to
     have gotten something from inside the house (entering by another route)
     before you can successfully enter here, however.
  G. The final entrance is through the doors between the veranda and the
     ballroom. You'll have to unlock and open them from inside the ballroom
     first, however.

Who is this woman who keeps throwing me out of the kitchen? How can I make
her stop?
  A. Her name is Lucy, and she is a friend of your father's. You'll probably
     want to talk to her.
  B. Lucy hasn't time to chat with beggars (your dress is looking pretty
     bedraggled without its hoops), or with fine ladies. Your boyish
     disguise could encourage her to chat.
  C. Enter the kitchen wearing the shirt and breeches.
  D. Remember to take the garter when Lucy offers it to you. It might be
     useful.

There is a loose slat at the back of the folly. Is it important?
  A. If you MOVE THE SLAT, a hole will be formed.
  B. If you GO THROUGH THE HOLE, you'll find a back entrance into the
     mansion.

How do I get the pistols in the Parlour?
  A. You can't.
  B. Really. You can't. So stop trying.


The Ball
********

I haven't been to a ball in so long! How can I get in?
  A. Since the veranda doors are locked, you'll have to enter past the
     butler in the foyer.
  B. Of course, if you don't look like a guest, the butler won't even let
     you in the house. You'll have to dress properly.
  C. Enter the foyer wearing a ball gown.
  D. You'll also need an invitation to give to the butler.

I don't have an invitation to the ball!
  A. If you haven't found an invitation, you obviously did not examine the
     coffer thoroughly before losing it to the sea. (Don't worry. This isn't
     necessary to win the game.)
  B. If you found the invitation, but left it aboard the _Helena Louise_,
     you could climb into the skiff and row out to the ship, get the
     invitation and then row back. This would work, but...
  C. The butler will take other compensation for your loss of the
     invitation.
  D. BRIBE THE BUTLER WITH THE BANKNOTE. No thug is above a little bribery.

I'm Cinderella, with nothing to wear to the ball! Where's my fairy
godmother?
  A. This is not a fairy tale! This is real life! (Well, as close to it as
     romance and interactive fiction ever come.)
  B. Have you found the Clearing yet?
  C. The Clearing is northeast of the forest. There are climbing vines
     there.
  D. If you climb up the vines, you can crawl into the second floor window.
     That which you seek is in that bedroom.

Lafond is threatening to kill my father unless I dance with him. What shall
I do?
  A. Dance with Lafond.
  B. Unless you've already rescued your father, in which case you may try to
     refuse him.
  C. But Lafond is not a man to toy with.


Rescuing Papa
*************

Jamison can't find Papa anywhere, nor can I. Where else should I look?
  A. Jamison has a theory about where a dungeon might be. Dance with him to
     find out.
  B. The Library is in the east wing of the house. Is there anything
     suspicious in the Library?
  C. Jean Lafond is depicted in the portrait in the Library in exactly the
     same pose as he is on the banknote. Examine the banknote that came in
     your game package for clues.
  D. Notice what Lafond is carrying.
  E. Notice what Lafond is wearing.
  F. Notice what Lafond is doing. This must be done last. Voila!
  G. Once you have done this you may simply CLOSE and OPEN THE PORTRAIT.

Lafond said he'd send for me when he was ready. I've been waiting around for
hours and nothing has happened. What's taking so long?
  A. Lafond is a busy man, with many things to take care of before he can
     relax. You should fill the extra time he's allowing you with the
     discovery and rescue of your father.

What do I do to get by the crocodile?
  A. The object is to render the beast incapable of biting you.
  B. There are two ways, actually.
  C. One way involves the garter. Go to Clue H for that solution.
  D. Another way involves the laudanum you found in the Crew's Quarters.
  E. You'll have to feed the crocodile something that has been doped with
     laudanum. Food would be best.
  F. There's something edible (to crocodiles) in the bottom of the cask in
     which you floated to shore.
  G. SQUEEZE THE LAUDANUM ON THE PORK. FEED THE PORK TO THE CROCODILE.
  H. The first clue for the alternate solution requires a brief foray into
     zoology: Crocodiles, while able to snap a log in two with their jaws,
     have weak muscles for opening those very same jaws. Thus, a strong man
     is capable of holding their jaws shut with his bare hands.
  I. Since you are neither a strong man nor able to sit around holding
     closed the monster's mouth, you have to find something else able to
     hold it shut for you.
  J. The garter is a likely candidate.
  K. Throw something at the reptile to get it to snap shut its jaws, then
     PUT THE GARTER ON THE CROCODILE.

Here's a locked cell and I have no key.
  A. Have you thoroughly searched the whole dungeon area?
  B. Have you been in the Guard's Cell?
  C. The key is on the cot in the Guard's Cell.

Robert's fallen into the quicksand! How can I save him?
  A. Look around for a large branch.
  B. Get the fallen branch in the forest.
  C. Drop the branch into the quicksand for Robert to grab hold of...
  D. But this probably won't work since there's no branch, no quicksand and
     no Robert in this game.


Lafond's Bedroom
****************

Where is Lafond's room?
  A. It is through the door in the north wall of the upstairs east hallway.
  B. It is also the only room on the second story with a window facing
     seaward.

How can I escape Lafond's clutches? I'm in his room, helpless and terrified.
  A. DRINK THE WINE whenever Lafond tells you to.
  B. Make sure there's nothing in the wine you drink, however.
  C. Ever hear the ditty, "The pellet of the poison's in the chalice from
     the palace,/ The vessel with the pestle has the brew that is true"?
  D. POUR WINE INTO THE GREEN GOBLET. Then put something else into it.
  E. SQUEEZE LAUDANUM INTO THE GREEN GOBLET. When Lafond is busy on the
     other side of the room, obviously.
  F. But Lafond knows you're doing something! So double-cross the devious
     dog!
  G. Lafond realizes that you've tampered with at least one of the glasses,
     so he pretends to have forgotten which is his. If you type YES to his
     question (If the green goblet is his?) then he'll assume you poisoned
     that glass, since you want him to drink from it. If you type NO, then
     he'll assume you drugged the other (blue glass). Then, being the cruel
     tyrant he is, he'll force you to drink from whichever glass he thinks
     you want him to drink from. Of course, if you lie...
  H. When Lafond asks if the green goblet is his, type NO if you have put
     the laudanum in it. (If you've drugged the blue goblet, type YES.)
     Then, when he forces you to drink the wine you indicated, imbibe "the
     brew that is true." This leaves the poisoned wine for...
  I. The butler, not Lafond, unfortunately. So, it doesn't quite work the
     way you planned; at least the butler is taken care of.

The butler is napping in the hall, but I can't stop Lafond from pawing me!
  A. This is a spicy puzzle.
  B. Have you thoroughly examined the chicken and spices?
  C. The spices are dry. Have you tasted or smelled them?
  D. They are HOT!
  E. TAKE THE PEPPER THEN BLOW THE PEPPER AT LAFOND.

I've gotten rid of Lafond, but the butler won't let me leave the room!
  A. SQUEEZE THE LAUDANUM into one of the goblets, then POUR THE WINE into
     that goblet.
  B. WALK SOUTH. The butler will think you're trying to escape, and follow
     you back into the room.
  C. GIVE THE (drugged) GOBLET TO THE BUTLER. No thug is above a little
     wine.
  D. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. It takes a little while for the drug to take effect.
  E. Don't waste any time, however. Lafond will be back soon!

I've made it out of Lafond's room, but he catches me afterwards!
  A. In such situations, one should get some outside help.
  B. Cookie and the crew aboard Jamison's ship might provide some
     assistance.
  C. Signal the ship from an eastward-looking window.
  D. Wave the mirror in the moonbeam shining through the window of Lafond's
     room. The pirates will respond.
  E. If you've lost the mirror, you can use the silver tray.


Rescuing Nicholas
*****************
(If you haven't been in Lafond's room, don't develop these.)

Oh no! I can't get past this crocodile again!
  A. In such situations, one should get some outside help.
  B. Cookie and the crew aboard Jamison's ship might provide some
     assistance.
  C. Signal the ship from an eastward-looking window.
  D. Wave the mirror in the moonbeam shining in the window of Lafond's room.
     The pirates will respond.
  E. If you've lost the mirror, you can use the silver tray.
  F. If you lead Cookie to the crocodile, he'll take care of the beast for
     you.

Cookie is asking me if I know where Jamison is. What do I say?
  A. If you think about it, you might have a good guess to where he is.
  B. Lafond told his lackeys where to take Jamison.
  C. You've been there before.
  D. Jamison is in the Dungeon.
  E. Type YES and lead Cookie to the Dungeon.

I've found Jamison, but Crulley won't let me near him!
  A. You're going to have to take some action here.
  B. Jamison's rapier might help you out.
  C. ATTACK CRULLEY WITH THE RAPIER.
  D. That time, in surprise, he stepped toward the trapdoor. Maybe one
     more...?
  E. ATTACK CRULLEY WITH THE RAPIER (again). He'll fall down the well.
  F. But don't dawdle. He'll be back.

Now I can't free Nicholas!
  A. There's no key for the manacles. Or if there is, it's down the well.
     You'll have to find some other way to unlock the manacles.
  B. Of course, a fine lady may never have picked a lock before, but now is
     the time to learn.
  C. Using the pin of the back of the brooch that Nicholas gave you, pick
     the locks on the manacles.
  D. UNLOCK THE MANACLES WITH THE BROOCH.

Now I can't wake Nicholas!
  A. A lady always carries something to prevent her swooning.
  B. REVIVE NICHOLAS WITH THE SMELLING SALTS.

Men! I woke and freed Nicholas, but he kissed me and ran off! Where'd he go?
  A. Off to avenge your honor and his brother's life, just as he told you.
     You'd better get after him, though. He's in no shape to duel Lafond.


The Endgame
***********

They're duelling in the ballroom! How can I stop them?!
  A. First of all, get to someplace where you can see the duel.
  B. Now that you're in the Gallery, do you see anyway to transport yourself
     down to the dance floor?
  C. The rope! This is a pirate story! What do pirates ALWAYS do?! (Besides
     rape, pillage and plunder.)
  D. Apes do it, monkeys do it, even Tarzan of the Jungle. You do it, you...
  E. SWING ON THE ROPE. Untie the rope first.

Alack, alas! Lafond has killed Nicholas! Where shall I turn? What can I do?
What shall become of me?
  A. Some awfully unpleasant things are going to happen to you unless you
     RESTORE to an earlier point in the game. And this time, rescue Nicholas
     Jamison!

They're duelling on the beach! How can I stop them?!
  A. Men will play their little wars. In this case, you can do nothing to
     stop them.
  B. However, you can stop a cold-blooded murder from happening just after.
     Keep an eye on Crulley.

Crulley's about to kill Nicholas! What can I do?
  A. There's no time to get to Crulley, and yelling to Nicholas will only
     bring disastrous results. There are at least three long distance
     remedies.
  B. One obvious remedy involves the pistol dropped by Lafond in his jump.
     Another method is explained starting with clue E. The third way out is
     detailed in clue H.
  C. LOAD THE GUN WITH THE GUNPOWDER. (You will have found the gunpowder in
     the Guard's Bunkroom.)
  D. Then you may either FIRE GUN or SHOOT CRULLEY. (See the explanation of
     the various conclusions.
  E. Another method uses the stone you step on as you run on the beach.
  F. And the garter; David and Goliath style.
  G. PUT THE STONE IN THE GARTER. SLING THE STONE AT CRULLEY. (See the
     explanation of the various conclusions.)
  H. ENTER THE SKIFF. ROW TO THE SHIP. (See the explanation of the various
     conclusions.)


Explanations of the Four Different Conclusions
**********************************************

The four possible final ranks are:
  A. Love Transcending Death. You can get this rank if you FIRE THE PISTOL
     INTO THE AIR.
  B. Orphan. If you put the stone into the garter and sling it at Crulley.
  C. Pirate Queen. Climb into the skiff as soon as you get to the beach,
     and row towards the ship.
