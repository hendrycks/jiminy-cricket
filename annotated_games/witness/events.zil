"Somewhere near Los Angeles. A cold Friday evening in February 1938. In
this climate, cold is anywhere below about fifty degrees. Storm clouds
are swimming across the sky, their bottoms glowing faintly from the city
lights in the distance. A search light pans slowly under the clouds,
heralding another film premiere. The air seems expectant, waiting for
the rain to begin, like a cat waiting for the ineffable moment to
ambush.|" CR "The taxi has just dropped you off at the entrance to the
Linders' driveway. The driver didn't seem to like venturing into this
maze of twisty streets any more than you did. But the house windows are
full of light, and radio music drifts toward you. Your favorite pistol,
a snub-nosed Colt .32, is snug in its holster. You just picked up a
match book off the curb. It might come in handy. Good thing you looked
up the police file on Mrs. Linder's death. Her suicide note and the
newspaper story told you all you know about the family. The long week is
finished, except for this appointment. But why does an ominous feeling
grip you?|" CR>>

noon."

the GOAL-ENABLE flag in the GOAL-TABLE for a character."

Freeman Linder discovered about a year ago that his wife had taken a
lover, Ralph Stiles. This discovery made their marriage deteriorate,
with growing bitterness and belligerence, until Mrs. Linder recently
took her own life with a gun. Linder planned to take revenge on Stiles
by framing him for attempted murder. He enlisted the help of his butler,
Phong, and his daughter, Monica.|
" CR
"Linder simultaneously sent two messages, a telegram to you and a phone
call to Stiles. He wanted you to come to the house, witness the alleged
crime, and then arrest Stiles. In the phone call he told Stiles to come
discreetly to the office door at 9:00 to get some pay-off money.|
" CR
"Linder planned an elaborate set-up inside the office. A gun was put in
the clock, aiming through the keyhole toward him, who would be sitting
behind his desk on the opposite side of the room. Using the butler's
button, he would trigger both the gun and the detonation of some
explosive attached to the window, thus simulating a shot fired through
the window at him.|
" CR
"Monica bought two identical small handguns for this plan. She hid one in
the clock, and Phong planted the other, which was fired in secret
beforehand, in the back yard just before 9:00, where you could find it
later.|
" CR
"When Stiles's car appeared, Phong went to the front door, rang the door
bell as a signal to Linder, and sneaked into the house. Linder kept an
eye on the window and, when Stiles appeared, pushed the button to fire
the shot. Stiles panicked and fled out the back of the yard but was
brought back inside by Sgt. Duffy.|
" CR
"The plot thickened, however, because Monica decided to take this
opportunity to murder her father. Her mother and she were very close.
Mr. Linder was often away on business during Monica's childhood, and
Mrs. Linder imbued her daughter with a love/hatred for him, saying that
he abandoned them. Monica helped her father construct the
remote-controlled gun, but she also blamed him for her mother's death
and had lost all love for him. She therefore aimed the gun to kill her
father when fired. Her idea was to convict Stiles of the murder and go
free herself.|
" CR
"Phong had no idea of Monica's plan until he saw Linder's corpse. He did
not spill the beans on Linder's plan, since he also had reason to want
Linder removed from the scene. Monica, as a last resort, may have attempted to
convince you that her father was dying of a stomach tumor and had
planned his own death. But Monica is the only one who could have twisted
Linder's plan into murder: the key to the clock was hidden on her
person, so she had final control of the gun's aim.|

A few days pass, and you don't hear from Linder.
