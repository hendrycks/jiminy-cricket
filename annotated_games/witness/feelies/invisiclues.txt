  F. Try pushing the button in the office before the gunshot.
  G. Linder won't let you, because it's important in his plan.

     handwriting to get any result.

What should I do with the threatening note?
  A. Try showing it to various characters.

Is there anything useful in the workshop?

  B. Of course, if you haven't seen any footprints, you can't analyze them.

  F. This shows that Stiles really is in the back yard at the time of the
     gunshot.

Can I determine anything from the footprints in the side yard?
  A. If you analyze the footprints, you'll get a cast that you can compare
     with people's shoes.
  B. Of course, if you haven't seen any footprints, you can't analyze them.
  C. And you'll have to be careful not to make a mess in the muddy yard.

     Stiles to arrive.

Will the footprints in the front yard help me solve anything?

  I. There aren't any footprints in the front yard.
  J. Remember the warning in the introduction: Do not use the presence or
     absence of a question on a certain topic as an indication of what is
     important, and don't assume that long answers are associated with
     important questions.

What if my cast doesn't match anybody's shoes?
  A. Maybe someone went through the yard and then left the property.
  B. Or maybe they just changed shoes.
  C. Where could one change shoes without tracking mud through the house?
  D. There's a platform for storing shoes in the front entry.

Who rings the doorbell?

Who calls on the phone?

Why does Phong go outside?

Where is the key?
  A. One person has the keys for all the doors in the house.
  B. That's Phong.
  C. Only one person knows for sure where the clock key is.
  D. That's Monica.
  E. She has it all the time, but you can't discover that until after she
     uses it.
  F. Try handcuffing and searching her after she uses it.
  G. You have to prove where the fatal bullet actually comes from, in order

  D. Part of the persuasion was an offer of money.
  E. If you're still outside when Stiles arrives, Linder doesn't know you're
     there, so he gives Stiles some money and sends him away.

  E. Who is that person that shows up just before dawn?
  F. Nobody shows up just before dawn.
  G. In fact, Terry never shows up at all.
  H. By the way, what gender have you assumed for Terry?
  I. Remember the warning in the introduction: Do not use the presence or
     absence of a question on a certain topic as an indication of what is
     important, and don't assume that long answers are associated with
     important questions.

Why does Duffy arrive at the house?
  A. At the beginning of the story, you don't expect to need Duffy.
  B. But he shows up anyway, about 9:00.
  C. Available and helpful, as usual.
  D. In fact, you can ask Duffy for hints, if you want.

What is Linder's motive?
  A. Could his death be suicide?
  B. Maybe he's sticken [sic] with grief over his wife's death.
  C. Maybe he has a fatal disease.

  E. It's in a messy place, where you have to search for it carefully.
  F. It's in Monica's room, on her desk.
  G. The medical report says that Linder will die soon and painfully.
  H. Try analyzing the report or showing it to Duffy before he goes to the

     false.
  J. Linder has no motive for suicide, only for framing Stiles.

What is Monica's motive?
  A. She could blame Stiles for her mother's suicide.
  B. Try asking her about him.
  C. But you'd better do it either before she sees the corpse or after she
     admits her part in Linder's plan.

  E. Try asking Phong about the suicide. Or try asking Monica about her
     mother or her father or the affair.

  C. Or try asking Monica about Linder's will after she sees the corpse.
  D. She will tell you something that establishes Phong's motive.
  E. Phong's motive is that he thinks Linder deceived him about his job and
     the money he would make.

What incentive does Stiles have to commit the murder?
  A. It certainly seems obvious, doesn't it?
  B. That's what Linder wants you to think.
  C. But when Stiles answers any of your questions, he pleads innocence.
  D. Try asking him about Mr. or Mrs. Linder.
  E. (WARNING: Don't read further unless you think you know what it says!)
  F. Actually, Stiles doesn't want to shoot anybody.

Can you establish a motive for Terry?
  A. Terry really wanted to see this movie.
  B. When Monica suggested going out, it was easy to choose this movie.

     Monica. Would you?
  D. Oops! Were you assuming that Terry has a motive for a crime?
  E. If so, you're wrong.
  F. By the way, what gender have you assumed for Terry?

How does this story end?
  A. If you don't arrest someone before 8:00 a.m., Police Chief Klutz
     arrives to take you away, but not for a well-deserved rest.
  B. If you try to attack, kill, or shoot another character, you have a
     50-50 chance of succeeding and getting taken away.
  C. If you're not sitting down when the gunshot goes off, you have a 50-50
     chance of dying from it.
  D. If you're poking around in the wrong place when the gunshot goes off,
     you die from it.
  E. If you don't enter the house soon enough for Linder's plan, he doesn't
     get shot, and the story ends with a postscript about Stiles getting
     shot a few days later.
  F. Otherwise, the story ends when you arrest one or more people.
  G. And, if you try to arrest more than two people, you can't.
  H. Further, if you try to arrest two people, and they're not Monica and
     Phong, you can't.

How do I prove my case to the satisfaction of a jury?
  A. You need to establish "method, motive, and opportunity": That means you
     need either physical evidence or reliable testimony that proves how the
     crime was committed, why the suspect did it, and when the suspect had
     the opportunity to do it.
  B. (WARNING: The following hints tell what the method was and how to prove
     it.)
  C. You can prove the actual murder method either by proving that a gun was
     in the clock and was set off by the butler's button, or by getting
     Monica or Phong to spill the beans.
  D. You can prove that a gun was in the clock either by analyzing the
     gunpowder on the keyhole or by finding the gun itself in Monica's
     possession.
  E. You can prove that the button set off the gun by pushing it between the
     time Linder is shot and the time Monica gets home.
  F. Monica will spill the beans if you accuse her after seeing her remove
     the gun from the clock, or if you ask her about the gunpowder, or the
     grandfather clock, or the butler's button, after you have proven the
     button connection.
  G. Phong will spill the beans if you accuse him after finding the gun
     receipt and matching his boots to the footprints in the side yard, or
     if you ask him about the gunpowder or the grandfather clock or the
     butler's button after you have proven the button connection.

What are the possibilities when I make the arrest?
  A. If you haven't proved the actual murder method, the D.A. refuses to
     indict, claiming the evidence is too flimsy. (But your boss gives you a
     suggestion that should help you next time you play.)
  B. Exception: You can arrest the corpse and get a silly ending.
  C. Another exception: You can arrest Stiles and get him convicted, but a
     postscript tells you that he is later released when some unspecified
     new evidence is found.
  D. If you have proved the murder method, the ending depends on whom you
     arrest.
  E. If you arrest Stiles, he is acquitted because of his lack of access to
     the Linder house.
  F. If you arrest the corpse, the coroner makes an unsatisfying ruling. If
     you haven't seen the medical report, the coroner reaches no conclusion;
     otherwise, the coroner rules suicide, but your boss doesn't believe it.
  G. If you arrest both Monica and Phong, and have seen the gun receipt, and
     have established Monica's motive and opportunity (the latter either by
     seeing her remove the gun or by opening the clock yourself with the
     key), then you have a pretty good case against them. However, Phong
     confesses only to conspiring in Linder's plan and gets a suspended
     sentence; then Monica manages to get the same deal. Your boss is not
     satisfied with this result.
  H. If you arrest Phong with or without Monica, but you _haven't_ met all
     these conditions, Phong is acquitted because he lacks the mechanical
     skills necessary to construct the hidden gun mechanism. If you also
     arrest Monica, she too is acquitted: either for lack of motive or
     opportunity, or, if you haven't seen the gun receipt, because Phong
     was.
  I. If you arrest Monica alone, and you have established motive but not
     opportunity, she is acquitted for circumstantial evidence. If you have
     established her opportunity, you win!
