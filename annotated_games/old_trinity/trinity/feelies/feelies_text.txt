SUNDIAL
Man first conceptualized time
as consisting of only two units Â·
day and night. Then came the
understanding thal daytime could
be separated into smaller units
marked by the shadows cast by the sun on its path from swuise ta
sunset. The sundial evolved as a means of indicating the passage of
time according to these units.

1. Carefully cut out the two shapes.
Make sure NOT to cut at the doued line.
2. To form the gnomon (triangular
shaped object), fold along the
dotted line.
3. Carefully cut a slot through the eye on the
base. The black bar through the eye represents
the location of where the slot should be.
4, To attach the gnomon to the base, insert flaps
A and B into the slot, taping the flaps to the underside.
5. To complete the sundial, fold the base along
its center line. Secure with tape or glue.
