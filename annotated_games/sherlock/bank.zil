		<TELL CR "Holmes plucks you by the sleeve and reaches into
the box. \"Observe, Watson.\" He pulls out an almost invisible thread and
examines it with glittering eyes. \"Muslin,\" he declares, more to himself
than to you. \"Of Indian origin, and of the type used almost exclusively in
the manufacture of turbans.\" He looks at you in triumph. \"Our case is
almost complete, Doctor. The Agra gems, the Trichinopoly cigar, and now this
strand of muslin.\"" CR CR

"Holmes puts the strand into his pocket and explains. \"Moriarty - for reasons
as yet unknown to us - has stolen the Crown Jewels. The Agra gems have somehow
passed into his hands by way of this Indian accomplice, and he is using small
pieces of it to lure me into a rendezvous with him. It's a dangerous game we
play, Watson, but if we are to recover the regalia we have no choice.\"" CR>)>>
