significantly from those of the third dynasty. The most pronounced change
involved a slight flaring of the handles from one dynasty to the next. Most

for the reddish-brown pottery from which they take their name, and for
interring their dead in single graves under round barrows. This culture
disappeared in the Middle Bronze Age (circa 1800 B.C.) and has been annoying

	   "Louis I, son of Charlemagne, ascended France's throne in 814 A.D.
He was the first to implement that country's secret policy of naming all their
kings Louis in order to confuse enemy agents, historians, and their own
peasants." 
	   "The first workers' strike on record took place in Egypt in 1170
B.C., when labourers building a new pyramid in Thebes learned that their
payroll had been delayed. They organized a protest, stopped working, and
picketed the construction site carrying papyrus signs that read, 'Cash on
the line, or you don't get your shrine.' Tradition also has it that the
slogan they chanted was 'Stuff the crypt...We've been gypped...Ra Ra Ra.'"
	   "The confusion between the usage of the present subjunctive and the
past subjunctive is easily resolved as long as one remembers that the terms
refer not to different times, but to differing sorts of uncertainty. Reference
to time itself is only implied by the use of the past perfect subjunctive.
While no deaths have as yet resulted from incorrect usage, it would be
prudent not to take chances."
	   "While uncovering one's head is a symbol of respect in many
cultures, in others the opposite is true. Some Indian religions, for example,
require that a man's head remain covered at all times, giving rise to the use
of the turban, or 'imamah.' The tabu against removing one's turban eventually
became so strong that thieves who thought nothing of stealing a victim's
clothes would nevertheless leave his turban undisturbed."
	   "Most historians ascribe Catherine de Medicis's poor reputation
among the French to her ordering the wholesale massacre of French citizens in
1572. Recent research, however, has revealed that years before, in 1533,
she brought into the country such vegetables as broccoli, artichokes,
cabbage and haricot beans - and it is now widely accepted that this
alone was sufficient to make the French hate her."
