former member of the American military, but it was Huttinger
who led the Allied forces during the liberation of Litzenburg in 1945,

How ironic that the Kremlin chose this time, this place for the death
of one of Litzenburg's only heroes. Even more ironic is that the irony is
almost certainly lost on them."

Sure there'll be some forms to fill out, and there'll be some
questioning, but you'll survive. You smile, and look over the scene -
one corpse, one agent with a lot of potential, but a little rough

it will have to wait. You walk through the door, tipping your
hat to your unconscious counterpart. \"Until we meet again.\"|
