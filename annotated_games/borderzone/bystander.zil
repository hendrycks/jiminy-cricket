Epilogue|
|
Two days later, in your hotel room in Vienna, you notice a headline
referring to an attempted assassination of a high-ranking American
diplomat in the small border town of Ostnitz, Litzenburg. Accounts
were sketchy, but it appears as if local police were tipped off about
the impending attack in time to prevent it.|

Congratulations! You get no medals, but you've successfully finished
the first chapter of Border Zone. The story continues with Chapter 2:[RWD_ID: bystander:2844, VAL: 3]
The Border. To start, type CONTINUE at the next prompt.
