"\"	Flood Control Dam #3|
|
FCD#3 was constructed in year 783 of the Great Underground Empire to
harness the mighty Frigid River. This work was supported by a grant of
37 million zorkmids from your omnipotent local tyrant Lord Dimwit
Flathead the Excessive. This impressive structure is composed of
370,000 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the center, and 193
feet wide at the top. The lake created behind the dam has a volume
of 1.7 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million square feet, and a
shore line of 36 thousand feet.|
|
The construction of FCD#3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
the dedication. It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
tree. The work was managed by a command team composed of 2345
bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
processors, and nearly one million dead trees.|
|
We will now point out some of the more interesting features
of FCD#3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities:|
