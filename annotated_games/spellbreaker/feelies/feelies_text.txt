looming destruction of magic itself, and only you can save it.
You owe your position as leader to of the esteemed Circle of Enchanters to your
consistently brilliant use of magic. But now magic has become unreliable and frighteningly unfamiliar.
The very foundations of the kingdom are threatened.
Who, or what, is causing this calamity? In a journey through the structure of the magical universe, from the Zorkian underworld to the far reaches of uncharted dimensions, you must search for the source of the unmaking. The outcome is uncertain when Evil's dark purposes are at last exposed in the final confrontation.
