'SNEFFLE " of the Guild of Bakers is addressing the gathering. \"Do you know what this is doing
to our business? Do you know how difficult it is to make those yummy butter
pastries by hand? When a simple 'gloth' spell would fold the dough 83 times
it was possible to make a profit, but now 'gloth' hardly works, and when it
does, it usually folds the dough too often and the butter melts, or it
doesn't come out the right size, or...\" He stops, apparently overwhelmed by
the prospect of a world where the pastries have to be hand-made. \"Can't you do
anything about this? You're supposed to know all about magic!\"">)

flavored or worse. The last vat, I swear it, tasted as if grues had been
bathing in it. It takes magic to turn weird vegetables and water into
good Borphee beer. Well, without magic, there isn't going to be any
beer!\" This statement has a profound effect on portions of the
crowd. You can hear rumblings from the back concerning Enchanters. The
word \"traitors\" rises out of nowhere. Your fellow Enchanters are
looking at one another nervously.">)

magic. But I do know that the wild beasts are kept out of the towns and
villages not just by the huntsmen, but by spells as well. Just
yesterday, one of my men was attacked and badly wounded by a troop of
rat-ants. They'd slipped the bounds set down by a 'fripple' spell

In the midst of his
splendid peroration, just as he was sketching out an insulting
mythological allusion in iambic hexameter, the poet turns even greener
than usual. His chin elongates and his skin begins to look sort of
slimy. In the blink of an eye there stands at the podium, not the
orator, but rather a large orange newt. \"Breek! Co-ax! Co-ax!\" it
protests.|

As you look around the room in shock, you discover that
Ardis is not alone. Each and every guildmaster in the room has been
turned into a frog, salamander, or other amphibian! All but one, that
is: yourself!|
