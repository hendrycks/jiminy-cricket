  B. ...following her?
  C. ...going out the French Doors and around the house?
  D. ...going out the Back Porch and around the house?

     from the covered walkway?
  F. If you have tried all these, you know that you can't get to the office

  B. It's too late for Veronica. Call the police.

Why is the Detective so unobservant?

     The WITNESS(tm), and we all know how well you did on those, don't we?
  B. Well, if the Detective were too good, there wouldn't be much of a role
     for you, would there?
  C. The Detective will do very few things without being prompted by you.

     they retire to the Ballroom to consider what (if anything) they've
     learned.
  D. The Detective will perform analyses for you if you ask, and will make
     some helpful comments about the evidence you produce. Of course, if you

     chance.

  A. Have you tried showing any to the other guests?
  B. Show the evidence to the Detective and Sergeant Duffy.

  D. Oops, just kidding.
  E. Be friendly, not threatening.
  F. Try to pet him a few times.

     there, too, after leaving the insurance policy under a bale of hay.

  D. If you leave it alone, Smythe will clean it up and throw it away in the
     kitchen.
  E. Send the Detective to the kitchen to examine the glass.
  F. If Muhammad won't go to the mountain...
  G. Take the trash basket to the Detective, then ask that the glass be
     fingerprinted.

What do the various costumes mentioned in the Ballroom mean?
  A. The man in the square plastic mask is wearing an old SUSPENDED(tm)
     package.
  B. The six-foot tall invisible rabbit is Harvey, the pooka.
  C. The others are even more obscure.
  D. Actually, that's a lie.
  E. The three blind mice aren't too obscure.
  F. Enough! You'll run out of developer ink!

     a reward for your perseverance, the next answer is going to reveal who
     committed the murder.
  I. Suzanne did it.
  J. Another lie. Actually, the authors own stock in a developing marker
     company, and this is just a ploy to make you use more fluid.
  K. Joanne did it.

  I. The yacht idea is sounding better all the time.

How do I get upstairs?
  A. All of the known ways are roped off.
  B. Did you find the ladder in the barn?
  C. Put the ladder against the house. It'll reach up to the second floor.
  D. What ladder?
  E. What master bedroom?
  F. Sorry. Just kidding. You can't go upstairs.

  A. Have you searched the room thoroughly?

  D. Have you tried hiding behind the chair?
  E. Once you've hidden, wait to see what will happen.

     Planning.

     out the significance of that Corporation.
  D.               >>This space intentionally left blank.<<

Where can I find the origin of the list?
  A. Backtrack from when Marston threw the list in the fireplace.

Was Michael involved in the murder?

  E. ...the purchase and sale agreement,...

THE EVIDENCE: Part I
********************

Do not develop these answers until you have solved the game (or are
absolutely mind-boggled).

NOTE: After you find anything suspicious, you can give it to the Detective
  so it will register as evidence. Some pieces, such as the first two,
  usually don't have to be shown to the Detective, as they will be noticed
  when the Detective first arrives at the office.

  Evidence                       Location

  Veronica's corpse              Office
  Your lariat                    Office
  Business card                  Office, in the waste basket
  Purchase and Sale Agreement    Office, in the manila folder
  Dark hair                      Office, _in_ the fairy mask
  Broken glass                   Kitchen, in the trash basket (once Smythe
                                 puts it there). You must have the Police
                                 fingerprint it for it to be useful.
  Wet overcoat                   East Coat Closet (after it has been hung
                                 up, either by Alicia or Smythe). By itself,
                                 this evidence doesn't prove anything.
                                 Further information must be revealed to the
                                 Detective.
  Rain                           Outside; from 9:10 to 9:30 it was drizzling
                                 rather than pouring. This contradicts the
                                 fact that Alicia's overcoat was sopping
                                 wet.
  Trust documents                Garage, in the BMW 320i trunk, after
                                 Michael has been there.

THE EVIDENCE: Part II
*********************

Don't develop this section unless you are absolutely sure who committed the
murder, but don't want to tell the Detective.

NOTE: There are pieces of evidence that, as a group, will scare the
  murderers into trying to escape. If that evidence is shown to both of them
  before being shown to the Detective, they will try to escape using the car
  hidden behind the Barn.

WARNING: The following section reveals the actual murderers. Do not proceed
  unless you are absolutely sure you want to.

  Show the following evidence to Michael:
    A. The trust folder.
    B. List of investors in Southeast Planning Corporation.

Do not read the following articles until after you have solved the murder.

Article 1

  WELLMAN AND BARRON CONVICTED IN ASHCROFT MURDER

  ROCKVILLE, March 8. Michael Wellman and Alicia Barron were convicted today
  of the first degree murder of Wellman's wife, Veronica Ashcroft. The jury
  deliberated for less than one hour before reaching its verdict. Colonel
  Robert Marston, head of the Ashcroft family trust, had already been
  convicted in a related case of embezzlement.
     Appearing before Judge N. S. Galley, District County Attorney John
  Castle summarized the case for prosecution:
     "Michael Wellman was already up to his neck in deception. He was
  involved with Col. Marston in the embezzlement of the Ashcroft Trust and
  in a love affair with his wife's so-called 'best friend,' Alicia Barron.
  When Veronica suggested a move up-county that would necessitate a
  significant drain on the Trust's funds, and possibly reveal Southeast
  Planning's thefts, Michael began to think of murder. When an accidental
  peek into a carelessly unlocked file cabinet revealed that Veronica knew
  of the thefts, he put his plan into motion.
     "Michael consulted with Col. Marston, whose reaction was to flee until
  the murderer convinced him he could placate Veronica and retrieve the
  evidence. It is only because all involved agree that Marston was not
  directly a part of the plot that he too was not indicted as an accessory.
     "Capitalizing on Alicia Barron's resemblance to Veronica in size and
  shape, Michael and his accomplice maneuvered Veronica into selecting a
  masquerade costume that completely obscured her face and head. A casual
  friend of the victim's, a reporter for the Washington Representative, was
  selected to 'take the rap.'
     "On the night of the party, Alicia secretly arrived early, and using
  one of Michael's keys, hid in the locked office. When the reporter arrived
  in a costume that included a lariat, Michael switched his intended method
  of murder to further implicate the hapless reporter.
     "After Veronica had been seen by the party guests, Michael lured her
  away to the office, where she was murdered. Michael retrieved the
  incriminating folder to be hidden elsewhere. Alicia donned Veronica's
  costume over her own flimsy one and returned with Michael to the Ballroom.
     "After a few minutes of boozy socializing as 'Veronica,' Alicia
  contrived an accident to her costume and left the Ballroom. She rushed to
  the office, redressed Veronica in the costume, and left through the back
  door to 'just arrive' at the front one.
     "It only remained for Michael to stay in the Ballroom, establishing his
  alibi, and to wait for the body to be discovered. Then he could dispose of
  the folder and fulfill his bargain with Marston by turning over the
  investor list with Marston's name on it."

Article 2

  SOCIALITES KILLED, FRIEND ARRESTED IN BIZARRE LOVE TRIANGLE

  RAPPANOC, November 1. Prominent hunt country socialite Veronica Ashcroft
  was murdered and her husband was killed last night during their annual
  Halloween Costume Ball. A friend of the family, Alicia Barron, is being
  held in the Rappanoc Women's Correctional Facility in connection with the
  deaths.
     Witnesses reported Ms. Ashcroft, dressed as a fairy queen, left the
  main area of the party after staining her gown and later was discovered in
  her office strangled with a lariat. Initially the Representative's
  reporter, who was covering the event, was suspected in the murder as the
  murder weapon was a lariat that was part of the reporter's costume.
     Astute detective work by our reporter allayed these suspicions, and
  pointed to a frame-up. The plucky reporter went on to prove it was
  Veronica's own husband and her self-described "best friend" who were
  guilty. When the pair were confronted with the damning evidence, they fled
  to the barn in an effort to escape. Ironically, Michael was trampled and
  killed by Veronica's prize horse "Lurking Grue" as he and Barron entered
  the barn without any light. Barron was arrested and held without bail.

Article 3

  REPORTER FOILS POLICE INVESTIGATION, SUSPECT STILL AT LARGE

  RAPPANOC, November 1. The murder investigation of hunt country socialite
  Veronica Ashcroft-Wellman was foiled last night by a Representative
  reporter. As a result, two suspects, Michael Wellman and Alicia Barron,
  escaped. Wellman was later found dead, apparently trampled to death by Ms.
  Ashcroft's horse, "Lurking Grue." Barron's whereabouts are still unknown.
     The reporter allegedly confronted the two with evidence believed to
  identify them as the murderers rather than turning the evidence over to
  the police. A get-away car, previously parked behind the barn by Barron,
  was used for her escape. Wellman was killed when he entered the horse barn
  without any light, causing the horse to panic.
     "I have never experienced such a flagrant act of egoism before,"
  declared the Detective. "The reporter deliberately interfered with my
  investigation, withheld evidence, and caused this aberration of justice."
