hundred thousand dollars, while Cochrane contends that he's wrong."

went for a high price last year. It was probably over a hundred thousand.\"
Col. Marston glares at him."

"Col. Marston says, \"I have a good memory for figures. The top price last
year was ninety two thousand. I even remember the horse, it was a chestnut,
about fifteen hands. Beautiful animal!\" Michael nods, apparently convinced.
Cochrane glances at Michael, feeling betrayed. \"Nonsense,\" he says, angrily."

"Cochrane takes another gulp of his drink. \"You're just
getting senile, Colonel. It was a black stallion, and I remember who bought
it. It was Jeffries! So there!\" He makes a gesture of
finality, almost spilling his drink on Marston, who is beginning to get
angry himself."

"Michael steps between them. \"Look here,\" he says, \"No need to fight.
We've got all the auction records in the office. Veronica
gets everything published. We can settle
this like gentlemen. Okay?\" Cochrane seems mollified, and
Marston comments under his breath, \"Some of us aren't gentlemen.\"
They head off towards the office."
