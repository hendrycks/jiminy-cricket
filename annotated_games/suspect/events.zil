It's Halloween night. " 'VERONICA " Ashcroft and her mania for Halloween parties
are putting new twists on a 110-year-old tradition. It isn't a very nice
night for a party. The rain has
been pelting down since early morning, but the weather hasn't deterred
many guests. The ballroom at Ashcroft Farm is filled with oddly costumed
visitors. The rather ridiculous " 'COWBOY-COSTUME " you are wearing was the
only thing you could find at the costumer's on such short notice, but
it's out of place only for its relative sobriety and taste in this
crowd.|

'VERONICA " is discussing an upcoming horse show. One of her horses, named
\"Lurking Grue,\" will appear, and she describes its attributes in glowing
detail, muffled only by the ornate mask covering her face and slurred by the
effects of whatever liquid it is she has in a large glass. Emphasizing a
point, she waves the glass on high, but it's affected her coordination as well
as her speech. A bright red liquid punctuated with ice cubes pours out
of the glass and all over her dress. As might be expected, the gown is
white. She utters a word that silver-winged fairies aren't usually expected
to know, and throws the glass to the floor. " 'MICHAEL " reaches under his robes
and takes out a handkerchief, dabbing futilely at the stain. " 'VERONICA " snorts
in exasperation and pushes him away. \"I'm

As your book explains, the murder was triggered by " 'VERONICA "'s desire to
sell the farm and move to a more rural area. Even with the proceeds of
the sale, still more funds from the family Trust would have been required
to purchase the new property and build on it. " 'MICHAEL " and " 'COL-MARSTON "
were alarmed, as they had been milking the Trust by investing in dummy
corporations under their control. After a time, " 'VERONICA " grew suspicious
and had the Trust's dealings investigated. She expected that " 'COL-MARSTON "
would be implicated, but was surprised to find that " 'MICHAEL " was an equal
partner in the scheme. For " 'MICHAEL ", time was running out. He wanted out of
the marriage, but not the Ashcroft fortune, and enlisted " 'ALICIA "'s help in
the bizarre scheme. " 'ALICIA " would impersonate the murdered " 'VERONICA " to
establish an alibi. Your appearance on the scene as an old friend suggested
another red herring. A few pieces of evidence planted, and you might be
framed. Fortunately for all but the plotters, the plans were for naught."><PRINT-ID "events:341">)>)
