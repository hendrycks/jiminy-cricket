At one time a shapeless and formless manifestation of evil was disturbed
from millenia of sleep. It was so powerful that it required the combined
wisdom of the leading enchanters of that age to conquer it. The legend tells
how the enchanters lured the Terror \"to a recess deep within the earth\" by
placing there a powerful spell scroll. When it had reached the scroll, the
enchanters trapped it there with a spell that encased it in the living
rock. The Terror was so horrible that none would dare speak of it. A comment
at the end of the narration indicates that the story is considered to be quite
fanciful; no other chronicles of the age mention the Terror in any form.")>

engines. These engines produced this world and others, strange and wondrous,
as a test or puzzle for others of their kind. It goes on to state that these
beings stand ready to aid those entrapped within their creation. The great
magician-philosopher Helfax notes that a creation of this kind is morally
and logically indefensible and discards the theory as \"colossal claptrap
