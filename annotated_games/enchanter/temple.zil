flickering torches cast a sallow illumination over the altar, which, atop
a row of stairs, is still drenched with the blood of human sacrifice. Behind
the altar is an enormous statue of a demon which seems to reach towards you
with dripping fangs and razor-sharp talons. Two open doorways lead out of the
temple to the east and west, while two wooden doors stand at the north and
south. A mass of hunched figures in the temple are chanting a haunting tune.
