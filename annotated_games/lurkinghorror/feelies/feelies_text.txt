He who climbs the steps of knowledge stands out among common men like blueberry in a pan of milk.
- George Underwood Edwards
WELCOME TO G.U.E.! 
You’ve probably been waiting to go to G.U.E. Tech for years  ever since you realized that science and math were
more important to you than just about anything (except eating). And now here you are, in a community of people
who feel exactly the same way. Of course, the first thing in your mind is academics, whether you can get a seminar
with that Nobel Laureate Physics professor, how soon can you have 24-hr access to the Computer Center, whether
you can get credit through a work-study program. Most of these questions can be answered by your freshman
advisor or by the official student handbook.
There are plenty of other questions, however, that you should also be asking yourself, questions that your advisor
will be hard put to answer. Questions like, where can you find the best pizza? Where can you find a date? Which
dorms should you avoid? Should you subscribe to the meal plan? Where can you go if you’re feeling out of control?
This handbook attempts to answer these questions. Written by upperclass students, G.U.E. At A Glance (sometimes
known as GAAG) might tell you things the Administration would rather you didn’t know. But we believe that you’ll
find them out anyway, and that you’ll be glad it’s sooner rather than later
In spite of what your roommate will tell you, G.U.E. Tech does not have the highest suicide rate in the country.
However, it is a high-pressure school. While you’re wondering what happened to the distraught student who used to
sit next to you in Introductory Calculus, you might also be wondering how
you’re going to get through midterms without cracking up.
When things get tough, DON’T PANIC. Help is always available, and no
one will think the lesser of you for seeking it. Visits to the Counseling
Center don’t appear on your permanent record, and complete
confidentiality is maintained at all times.
One thing that just might drive you crazy is figuring out how to get around
campus. While we’ve provided a map to help you identify the main dorm
and class buildings, you probably won’t feel at home until you’ve gotten
lost a few times and stumbled back to familiar ground.
Future Nobel Laureates experiment with the electron microscope. Mitch Clark ’89, shown at left, has won several
national science awards for his microphotographic studies of magnetic stress on conductive wires.

SCHOOL TRADITIONS 
Lock Day  In a bizarre twist on Caltech’s Ditch Day, seniors leave school, after locking the cafeteria doors with
intricate electronic equipment. Underclassmen must undo the electronic puzzles before they can eat.
Slug Stomping  Watch for the first slugs of the year and step on them.
Founder’s Day  One night during the last week of spring term, the huge bronze statue of George Underwood
Edwards mysteriously disappears from its pedestal and shows up the next day in some totally offbeat spot. A
certain rowdy fraternity is rumored to spend the entire year planning this prank.
Final Scream  At a designated time during Final Exam week, everyone screams in unison.
Pigeon Day  The President rings a bell at 6 a.m. one spring morning and puts a statue of a giant pigeon on the
lawn. No classes for the day; free food at night.
Streamer Day  Take all the toilet paper rolls from the bathrooms and throw them out of the dorm windows.

Large, underground tunnels connect most of the buildings.
However, many of these tunnels are very old, and a number have
been closed for safety reasons. While you may be tempted to
explore, DON’T risk it. Several deaths have been attributed to
student explorations in the tunnels. Close tunnels are off-limits;
they’re closed for a reason, and we encourage students to restrain
their curiosity and keep out of them.
It’s usually easiest for new students to live in a dormitory and
subscribe to the school meal plan. But easiest isn’t always the best.
In the case of G.U.E.’s food service, it’s worst. Food ranges from
bad to inedible, and the cafeterias are only open for a few hours
around each mealtime. If you haven’t signed up for the meal plan,
or when you’re planning ahead for next year, consider roughing it.
Dorm-sized refrigerators are easy to come-by, and the area
supermarkets carry a wide variety of both recognizable and exotic
items. When you’re looking for a hot meal, check our list of
favorite hangouts.
First-year students are usually stuck with whatever room they’re assigned to. Elrod Bok is the best freshman dorm;
Murani House is the worst. Best upper-class dorms are Berkowitz Hall and Lunce House. Chapelgate is wellknown
as a party dorm. It’s a good place to be if you like to party. It’s a bad place to be if you plan to get any
sleeping or studying done in your room.
Most dorms are co-ed, with men and women housed on separate floors. A few of the smaller upperclass dorms are
for men only, and Stella Barton Hall houses fifteen senior women.
You’ll also want to consider G.U.E.’s fraternities and sororities. Pledging takes place the first week on campus.
Since each house appeals to a different type, you’ll need to look into all of them to find one that’s good match for
you. For more information, contact the Interfraternity Council.
Dorm furniture is strictly functional and, if you’re lucky, less than 50 years old. Most students outgrow the door
bookshelf within one semester. You can buy cheap but sturdy bookcases at Dave’s Discount Decor, along with
bean-bag chairs, lava lamps, and designer telephones (one current favorite, a glow-in-the-dark skull with gleaming
red eyes, chortles instead of rings).

Although you’ll be spending most of your time studying, it’s important to
remember that life exists outside of your textbooks and your computer
screen. Take an afternoon to visit the Museum of Contemporary Art on the
Loeffler Aquarium. Join the Freshman Drama Group of the Hellenic Club.
Write a weekly column for the G.U.E. GNEWS. Take advantage of the
Athletic Complex, whose weekly paddleball tournaments draw a lively
crowd.
Students relax on the quad in front of Edwards Hall, one of the
architectural gems of G.U.E. Tech. The campus spans a century in building
design, ranging from the Victorian opulence of Edwards Hall to the
reflective glass facade of the Nutrition Building.

The bequest of George Underwood Edwards permitted the merger of several venerable institutions, including the
famed Hopewell Academy of Natural Science, into the George Underwood Edwards Institute of Technology.
Departments were founded in such radical disciplines as Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Biology, and
Architecture, and an exciting new campus was built along River Street. Although the campus has since expanded in
all directions, nearly all of the original structures remain. This map includes the buildings you’re most likely to use
every day. For a more detailed (although less portable) map of the area, refer to your Student Handbook.

SOME G.U.E. TECH JARGON:
frob. (noun) A thing. Useful when you have two unspecified objects on hand. Stick that frob on the thing over
there.
tool. (noun) A nerd. Someone who studies all the time, never taking time for a social life. (verb) To study. I’m
tooling tonight.
hack. (noun) A prank. Painting the Dean’s house pink was a great hack! (verb) To commit a prank. We hacked
the Dean’s house.
-p. (suffix) Adding the -p suffix to a word makes it a question. A derivative of the LISP computer language, where
p indicates predicate (e.g., greaterp x y, meaning is x greater than y?). Most commonly heard among tools
majoring in Computer Science. Foodp? (pronounced food-pee) means Are you hungry?
grease. (noun) Student politician. (verb) To pass a course without working on it. I greased Thermodynamics.
rug rat (or rat). (noun) Freshman. Presumably derives from the use of this term as a synonym for child.
urchin. (noun) A local child or teenager who hangs around campus and often causes object of value to mysteriously
disappear.
curdle. (verb) To astonish, usually with a connotation of the surprise being unpleasant. I was really curdled when I
saw my final grades.
flip. (verb) To kill time by some essentially boring means, such as playing Hearts. May derive from flipping
bottle caps, or perhaps baseball cards. I spent last night flipping.
midnight. (adjective) Before noon. Midnight class is a class held before noon. Midnight quiz is an early
morning quiz.

Men: Before driving to Oak Heaven Jr. College for the Friday Night Mixer, why not try Rudy’s Eating and Drinking
Saloon, two blocks down Capital Ave.? Or better yet, say hello to the woman sitting next to you in Bio 100.
Women: There’s no need to go anywhere. With a male/female ratio of 6:1, someone WILL say hello to you.
Another way to broaden your college life is to take a class entirely unrelated to your distribution requirements or
your major. The Zinc As Life Force Seminar in the Department of Alchemy is but one of the many unusual
courses you’ll find in your catalog.
Whatever you do, avoid Prof. Hampstop’s astronomy classes. He’s a tenured bore, and you can probably learn more
by just gazing at the sky. Also beware of: Prof. Tighe’s Intensive Metallurgy course; Dr. Morlock’s Introduction to
Fuel Gas Engineering; Dr. Negele’s Moral Philosophy classes; Prof.
Carlsen’s seminar in Textile Technology; and any junior instructor.
Above all, remember that all of us on the Social Committee were freshmen
once, too. Don’t feel shy about approaching one of us for wisdom or advice.
And don’t forget that we all made it through that tough first year at G.U.E.
So can you.
Biology students delve into mysteries of the digestive system. This popular
course makes full use of G.U.E.’s modern laboratory facilities.

FAVORITE HANGOUTS
Crust and Noodles  Best Italian restaurant in town.
Reilly’s Real Irish Pizza  Pizza delivery until 2 a.m.
Hoagie Shack  Good subs; pastrami and sauerkraut a traditional favorite.
Rudy’s Eating and Drinking Saloon  The local meat market.
Dot ’n’ Dash  24-hour diner, specializing in late night breakfast.
House of Roy  In Chinatown. Open late. Great food, and cheap.

ALMA MATER 
Words and Music by Maj. Chas. Gleason, ret., 22
Note: At the turn of the century, G.U.E. was commonly pronounced
gooey (rather than ’gee-you-ee’ as it is today). The former
pronunciation should be used when singing the alma mater.
When Georgie planned his Institute
Upon the river’s neck,
He little guessed the glories
That would fall on G.U.E. Tech.
(chorus)
So let’s all toast our founder
Raise high the glass of beer
There’s nothing we would rather be
Than a G.U.E. engineer.
Our commonwealth of farmers
Held industry on check,
Until a school for engineers
Broke ground at G.U.E. Tech
(chorus)
Architects built up the country
Designing bridge and deck,
The best were trained and tutored right
Here at old G.U.E. Tech
(chorus)
But G.U.E.’s more than labs and texts,
So let’s say What the heck!
On Pigeon Day we’ll take a break
From class at G.U.E. Tech!
(chorus)
The G.U.E. buddies that you make
Will long be at your back.
You’ll not find dearer friendships
Than those forged at G.U.E. Tech.
(chorus)
(repeat)
So let’s all toast our founder
Raise high the glass of beer
There’s nothing we would rather be
Than a G.U.E. engineer.
(It is customary for the chorus to be sung only by seniors and alumni, while the tune is
hummed by the underclassmen. The final chorus is repeated, with everyone joining in.)

MURRAYS Limbo BOOKSTORE
Serving the Institute since 1954
[The middle illustration is approximately like a man wearing a sandwich board advertisement, except that it is a
book that hinges in front of him instead of two pieces of wood with shoulder straps. His right hand is visible past
the edge of the book, and is holding a tall walking stick. His head is visible above the top of the book, and we can
see that he is wearing a wide-brimmed top hat and a large pair of round frame sunglasses. His feet are showing
below the book and have what appears to be formal boots with extra-long fronts which enclose the feet. The overall
look of the illustration is that of a fine-line drawing, such as what is used in the portraits of the Presidents on the
United States paper money. On the cover of the book are the following words:]
Thousands of used paperbacks and hardcovers in stock. Used textbooks in all subjects.
How
LOW
Can YOU Go?
At Murrays, the prices are always in limbo, because Murray loves to bargain! Make him an offer! See how low
hell go!
Murrays Limbo Bookstore, corner of Capital Avenue and Main Street. Open Monday through Saturday, 9 to 9.
