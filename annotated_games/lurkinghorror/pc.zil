to the movie \"The Warriors\" or \"Alien,\" but this is the last

\"He returns, he is called back (?)|
The loyal ones (acolytes?) make a sacrifice|
Those who survive will meet him (be absorbed? eaten?)|
They will live, yet die|
Forever will be (is?) nothing to them (to him?)|

\"His place (lair? burrow?) must be prepared|
His food (offerings?) must be prepared|
Call him forth (invite him?) with great power|
Only an acceptable (tasteful?) sacrifice will call him forth|
He will be grateful (satiated?)\"|
